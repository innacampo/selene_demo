    "[INTRODUCTION] Series www.thelancet.com Vol 403 March 9, 2024 947 Menopause 1 An empowerment model for managing menopause Martha Hickey, Andrea Z LaCroix, Jennifer Doust, Gita D Mishra, Muthusamy Sivakami, Deborah Garlick, Myra S Hunter Menopause eventually happens to all people with typically functioning ovaries, and almost one billion women worldwide are postmenopausal. Although the biology of typical menopause is ubiquitous, the experience varies substantially. Factors contributing to the experience include not only individual factors, such as the nature and severity of symptoms, but also psychological, social, and contextual considerations, many of which are modifiable. In this first paper in the Lancet Series on menopause, we argue for a new approach that goes beyond the treatment of specific symptoms, to encompass a broad model to support women transitioning this life stage, using the model of empowerment. WHO defines empowerment as an active process of gaining knowledge, confidence, and self- determination to self-manage health and make informed decisions about care. Rather than focusing on menopause as an endocrine deficiency, we propose an empowerment model that recognises factors modifying the experience, in which the patient is an expert in their own condition and the health-care worker supports the patient to become an equal and active partner in managing their own care. Background Although menopause is biologically inevitable, experiences vary considerably and are shaped by factors including symptoms, race and ethnicity, social meanings, expectations, self-esteem, life adversity, and general health. In many high-income countries (HICs), meno­ pause is commonly described as a medical problem and sometimes as a hormone deficiency disorder with typical symptoms and long-term health risks that are best managed by hormone replacement.1 However, this disease-based model is challenging in practice given the wide variation in experiences between women and their changing exper",
    "[INTRODUCTION] a medical problem and sometimes as a hormone deficiency disorder with typical symptoms and long-term health risks that are best managed by hormone replacement.1 However, this disease-based model is challenging in practice given the wide variation in experiences between women and their changing experiences over time. Also, the inevitability of menopause makes finding out whether long-term health outcomes are due to menopause or ageing difficult, particularly given the scarcity of adequate prospective data for long-term health consequences of premature or early menopause. Although management of symptoms is impor­tant, a medicalised view of menopause can be dis­empowering for women, leading to over-treatment and overlooking potential positive effects, such as better mental health with age and freedom from menstruation, menstrual disorders, and contraception.2 In this first paper in our Lancet Series, we consider a new approach to menopause that goes beyond the treatment of specific symptoms, based on the model of health empowerment. WHO defines empower­ment as an active process of gaining knowledge, confidence, and self-determination to self-manage health and make informed decisions about care.3 Although the principles of health empowerment have not previously been applied to menopause, in 2005 the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) identified the need to develop and disseminate information emphasising menopause as an ordinary, healthy phase of women’s lives and promoting its demedicalisation.4 Across several health domains there is growing evidence that empowerment is an effective tool to optimise self-management of health, which can also reduce health-care costs.5 To be empowered, women must be informed and listened to. Women have clearly stated that they want their voices heard and their experiences of menopause acknowledged and validated.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] that empowerment is an effective tool to optimise self-management of health, which can also reduce health-care costs.5 To be empowered, women must be informed and listened to. Women have clearly stated that they want their voices heard and their experiences of menopause acknowledged and validated. Unfortunately, some women report that their concerns are dismissed, particularly those from minority groups.6 We propose a more inclusive approach (empowerment include access to evidence-based and balanced information, preferably before the onset of menopause (panel), tools to support decision making around treatments for symptoms (eg, decision aids), and access to a supportive clinician who listens with empathy and offers treatment if needed by using a shared decision- making model (widespread stigma about menopause as a period of decline and decay and creating a more menopause-friendly work environment might help to empower women.8 In this paper, we focus on empowerment in the context of typical menopause. In other papers in the Series, we consider other types of menopause which might affect the experience and we believe warrant more attention: early menopause, menopause after cancer, and mental health during the menopause transition.

    "[INTRODUCTION] in the early 20th century, with the belief that women’s identity (so-called femininity) and physical and mental health was predicated on the balance between oestrogen excess or deficiency.1 A wide range of mental and physical disorders in women were (and still are) attributed to hormonal imbalance. Loss of oestrogen after menopause was thought to be individually and socially harmful, and to have consequences such as “untold misery of alcoholism, drug addiction, divorce and broken homes”.10 Oestrogen treatment emerged during the rejuvenation and anti- ageing movements of the early 1900s. Hormones extracted from animals were injected into humans to counter the perceived deficiencies of age.1 In women, oestrogens were widely prescribed for menstrual and reproductive disorders, pregnancy compli­cations (eg, diethylstilbestrol), psychoses, and depression.10 From the 1940s, purpose-designed hormone replacement therapy (HRT), extracted from pregnant mares’ urine, was widely promoted for the “unstable, estrogen-starved postmeno­ pausal woman”.11 Access to HRT has directly benefited many women, bringing the first effective treatment for menopausal symptoms and potential long-term benefits for younger menopausal women. However, as predicted by The Lancet in 1975, “The prospect of universal treatment of a large section of the female population is clearly a glittering commercial prize for the pharmaceutical industry” and uptake was rapid. By the mid-1960s around a third of UK women aged 50–64 were taking HRT, making it the most commonly prescribed medication in this population.12 Uptake was low in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where menopause is generally considered a part of the natural ageing process, bringing benefits, such as the cessation of menstruation.13 The use of HRT (now called menopausal hormone therapy [MHT]) plummeted in 2002, when a large randomised placebo-controlled trial (RCT) was terminated early due to its findings of an increased risk of b",
    "[INTRODUCTION] a part of the natural ageing process, bringing benefits, such as the cessation of menstruation.13 The use of HRT (now called menopausal hormone therapy [MHT]) plummeted in 2002, when a large randomised placebo-controlled trial (RCT) was terminated early due to its findings of an increased risk of breast cancer with combined MHT,14 inadequate benefit in the primary outcome (coronary heart disease), and increased risk of stroke with oestrogen-only MHT.15 This drop in MHT use was followed by a decreased incidence of breast cancer in some countries16 and an increased risk of fracture in others.17 Although long- term follow-up from this RCT has shown no increase in all-cause mortality after 5–7 years of MHT, uptake has never returned to previous levels in most countries. In the UK, use of MHT increased by around 60% between 2020 and 2022, particularly in women from the most affluent areas of the country.18 The reasons for this increased use are uncertain but might reflect the subtantial increase in media attention towards menopause. We argue that additional strategies beyond medication are needed to effectively support women as they transition menopause. Panel: How clinicians can support empowerment in the management of menopause Before menopause • Provide evidence-based information about what to expect • Challenge overly negative assumptions about menopause and ageing and encourage discussion with friends and family • Encourage routines that might reduce stress and improve mood—eg, mindfulness and exercise During the menopause transition • Provide reassurance and offer effective treatments for symptoms as requested • Provide realistic information about the likely effects of treatment, the potential for residual symptoms, and the possibility that symptoms could recur when treatment stops • Offer reassurance that vasomotor symptoms are usually time limited and might be most frequent in the year around the final menstrual period7 • Offer behavioural strategies that might",

Only publications in English were included. What is menopause? The menopause occurs with the final menstrual period; thus, the occurrence of menopause can only be determined in retrospect, and women are considered postmenopausal after 12 months with no periods.19 The timing of menopause is thought to be predicated on the size of the primordial follicle pool (ie, ovarian reserve), which is fixed by the time of birth.

    "[TREATMENT] ter 12 months with no periods.19 The timing of menopause is thought to be predicated on the size of the primordial follicle pool (ie, ovarian reserve), which is fixed by the time of birth. When the follicle count drops below a critical threshold, ovulation becomes intermittent and eventually stops. The process of going through the menopause starts with menstrual cycle changes and ends 1 year after the final menstrual period (following endometrial ablation or hysterectomy, and users of hormonal contraception might be uncertain about the timing of menopause. Menopause happens to all people with typically functioning ovaries who reach the relevant age. We recognise that this population includes some transgender men and other gender-diverse people; therefore, in some instances, we have referred to “people” rather than “women” to be as accurate and inclusive as possible. However, since much published work refers to people experiencing menopause collectively as women and does not clarify how findings might apply to the specific needs of gender-diverse people, we have also used “women” in some instances, to avoid inappropriate generalisation. Evidence on menopause in gender-diverse individuals is scarce and needs more attention.20 Predicting the onset of menopause Changes in the menstrual cycle are the most reliable indicator of the menopause transition.19 Blood tests, such as measurement of anti-mullerian hormone, are uninformative for women older than 45 years.21 The transition usually starts at around age 47 years in HICs and lasts for 4 years on average, with the average age at menopause being 51 years.21 Timing might be earlier in LMICs; for example, data from India indicate that the mean age at menopause is approximately 46 years.22 Globally, around 10% of women experience premature menopause (before age 40 years) or early menopause (at age 40–44 years),23 which can be iatrogenic (eg, following chemotherapy or radiation for cancer or bilateral oophorectomy) or sponta",

What symptoms are caused by menopause? In a large US longitudinal study, during the menopausal transition, prolonged menstrual bleeding affected more than 90% of women at least once and nearly 80% of women at least three times, and about a third of women had 3 or more days of heavy bleeding on at least three occasions.24 Heavy and irregular bleeding could affect many aspects of life, including work. Access to toilet facilities and breaks might help. The menopause transition is also when vasomotor symptoms are most likely to start.25 More information is needed about how best to manage bleeding problems and menopausal symptoms over this period. Apart from menstrual cycle changes, there is uncertainty about what other symptoms menopause causes, with no universal menopause syndrome.26 In 2005, an NIH interdisciplinary expert consensus concluded that many women have few or no symptoms and that only vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, and possibly sleep disturbance were clearly attributable to menopause.4 Subsequently, prospective studies reported that depressive symptoms and disturbances in sleep and FSH=follicle-stimulating hormone.

A pooled analysis of eight cohort studies of more than 21 000 women reported that 38% had moderate or severe vasomotor symptoms.36 A prospective US study (n=255) found that a third of women recruited before menopause had persistent moderate or severe symptoms for 10 years.37 Vasomotor symptoms seem to differ between ethnic and racial groups.",

For example, Black and Hispanic women report more severe vasomotor symptoms and Asian American women less severe vasomotor symptoms compared with White women,26 but less is known about minoritised racial and ethnic groups in other multicultural countries, such as the UK. Within the USA there might be sub-variations in the menopausal symptom experience of Asian women.38 As well as frequency and severity, other factors influence the experience of vasomotor symptoms, such as attitudes towards menopause and ageing, religion, socioeconomic status, lifestyle (eg, diet and exercise), and methodological limitations of individual studies.34 However, it is important not to make assumptions about women’s experience of menopause based on ethnicity or race. The degree of interference from vasomotor symptoms, which is strongly influenced by psychological, social, and biological factors, is a priority for menopausal women.39 There is a bi-directional association between vasomotor symptoms and stress, making stress a potentially modifiable factor. There is also a two-way association between vasomotor symptoms and depressed mood. Women with more severe vasomotor symptoms tend to report more depressive symptoms, and women who are depressed can find vasomotor symptoms hard to manage.40,41 Other potentially modifiable factors include smoking, high BMI, depressed mood, anxiety, and negative beliefs about menopause.",

Women with more severe vasomotor symptoms tend to report more depressive symptoms, and women who are depressed can find vasomotor symptoms hard to manage.40,41 Other potentially modifiable factors include smoking, high BMI, depressed mood, anxiety, and negative beliefs about menopause. Lifestyle and behavioural changes have shown some success in reducing troublesome symptoms, although findings are mixed (panel).36,42,43 Muscle and joint pains Most studies of menopausal symptoms were conducted in White women from HICs or in racial subgroups within these countries. Women in LMICs report substantial differences in the experience of menopause. Southeast Asian women in LMICs might be less troubled by vasomotor symptoms and more likely to report muscle and joint pains than women in HICs.44 MHT can modestly improve joint pain but the effect on muscle aches is unknown.45 Sleep disturbance Sleep disturbances are more common in women than in men across the life course and can increase over the menopause transition.46 Night-time awakenings due to vasomotor symptoms are common, but sleep can be disturbed for other reasons over this period, and conditions such as obstructive sleep apnoea or depression can contribute.46 Menopausal symptoms that disturb sleep can affect daytime function, including mood and concentration. An international, consumer-driven process to find out what outcomes should be measured in menopause clinical trials concluded that the effect of treatments on sleep was a priority area.47 Genitourinary symptoms Between 10% and 40% of postmenopausal women report symptoms such as vaginal dryness, vulvovaginal irritation or itching, and dyspareunia.48 Unlike vasomotor symptoms, these genitourinary symptoms tend to start after menopause and can persist into older age.

Genitourinary changes, such as vaginal dryness, can also be secondary to ageing. Other symptoms The effects of hormone changes can be difficult to differentiate from concurrent life events such as caring for children at home, managing paid and unpaid employment, taking responsibility for ageing parents, and balancing conflicting life roles.49 In particular, changes in mood and cognition and sexual difficulties commonly ascribed to menopause can be caused or exacerbated by these life stressors.50 Similarly, although subjective changes in concentration and memory are common over the menopause transition, these have not been clearly linked to long-term cognitive decline. Prospective studies of objective measures of cognition over the menopause transition show only small and mostly temporary memory changes in a minority of women, an observation that many find reassuring.51,52 Series www.thelancet.com Vol 403 March 9, 2024 951 Subjective changes in memory and concentration can be more common, but whether these changes are secondary to factors such as sleep disturbance is uncertain.53 Menopause and long-term health Natural menopause at the average age is associated with an increased incidence of some health problems and a reduced incidence of others. Although bone density is known to decline after menopause, whether menopause at the average age increases other chronic conditions such as diabetes, dementia, or cardiovascular disease is uncertain.

The average absolute weight gain associated with menopause was 1·6 kg.54 Managing menopausal symptoms Although there is uncertainty about the symptoms menopause causes, vasomotor symptoms are consistently reported and are the leading patient priority for treatment, followed by sleep, concentration, and fatigue.55 Psychological therapies The most troublesome aspects of vasomotor symptoms are frequency, severity, bother, and impact on sleep.55 Effective non-pharmacological treatments for vasomotor symptoms include purpose-designed cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and hypnosis.56 In 2022, a systematic review and meta-analysis including 14 RCTs reported that CBT was superior to control groups in reducing hot flushes, night sweats, sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, and fatigue and significantly improved quality of life, although effects were generally small to moderate.57 CBT also reduces problematic vasomotor symptoms at work and after breast cancer.58 CBT can be delivered in groups by health professionals, with the use of self-help books, online, or by telephone.58 Clinicians should advise patients that RCTs of acupuncture, plant-based therapies, and exercise have largely not shown benefit over placebo or sham procedure for vasomotor symptoms.59 Clinicans should offer advice about lifestyle factors, addressing sleep, alcohol, and smoking, which can exacerbate vasomotor symptoms (panel).

The North American Menopause Society recommends clinical hypnosis for vasomotor symptoms. This recommendation is based on two RCTs showing a statistically significant improvement in the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms.60,61 At 12 weeks the reduction in subjective hot flushes with hypnosis was 74·2% versus 17·1% in controls. Clinical hypnosis also reduced interference due to vasomotor symptoms and improved sleep quality. Hypnosis can be delivered by a trained provider or accessed on a smartphone app. Medical therapies The North American Menopause Society recommends specific MHT, gabapentin, and oxybutynin, which have mild to moderate efficacy and reduce hot flushes by 1–2 per day with no clinically significant improvement in menopause-related quality of life.60 Targeted therapy with the neurokinin B receptor antagonist fezolinetant is available in the USA and some European countries. Two large RCTs have compared the efficacy of fezolinetant versus placebo for vasomotor symptoms over 12 weeks, with a 40-week open label extension.62,63 With 45 mg per day (the dose now marketed), there was a statistically significant reduction in hot flush frequency and severity up to 1 year and serious adverse events were infrequent. Fezolinetant also improved menopause-related quality of life.64 Although clinical trials of neurokinin B receptor antagonists in patients with cancer have not yet been published, breast cancer is not a contraindication to fezolinetant use in the USA.

However, improvements in vasomotor symptoms with fezolinetant are modest and do not meet the minimally important clinical difference65 for hot flush frequency or menopause-related quality of life. A meta-analysis published in 2024,66 which included 2168 patients from five RCTs, reported a 22·5% mean improvement in frequency of vasomotor symptoms, with small improvements in menopause-related quality of life. In 2023, the independent US Institute for Clinical and Economic Review concluded that fezolinetant was less effective than MHT for vasomotor symptoms, and that MHT might provide additional benefits for sleep, vaginal dryness, and fracture prevention.67 Help-seeking for menopausal symptoms is highly contextual, but 13% of women in HICs are given MHT.36 In the UK, NICE recommends MHT after discussion of the short-term and long-term risks and benefits, which are likely to differ according to patient’s age and type of MHT.68 For those with problematic symptoms, MHT generally leads to statistically and clinically significant reductions in vasomotor symptom frequency and severity, along with improvements in menopause-related quality of life.67 For standard (1 mg) and low (0·5 mg) dose estradiol, this improvement equates to around 2–4 fewer hot flushes per day versus placebo, which might not be clinically meaningful for those with very frequent symptoms.67 Vasomotor symptoms can co-occur with sleep and mood disturbance69,70 and a 2022 systematic review reported that MHT led to small improvements in sleep.71 However, the primary indication for MHT is the treatment of problematic vasomotor symptoms.72 MHT might improve sleep, memory, and concentration in women taking it for vasomotor symptoms but it is unlikely to have any effect in women without vasomotor symptoms.73 For symptom clusters such as hot flushes, disturbed sleep, and depressed mood, RCTs show that CBT is eff",

Patients’ priorities for symptom control should inform shared decision making around treatment. Although combined and oestrogen-only MHT preparations have similar efficacy, their risk profile differs. For example, a 2004 RCT of more than 27 000 women showed that combined MHT increased breast cancer risk, but oestrogen-only MHT did not.15 More recently, large observational studies including individual participant meta-analyses from over 108 000 patients with breast cancer found that all types of systemic MHT increased risk of breast cancer; risk was substantially greater with combined MHT compared with oestrogen alone. The authors estimated that about one in 50 users of combined MHT will develop breast cancer after 5 years of continued use.75 Combined MHT is the most frequently prescribed form of MHT. In the UK, an estimated 80% of MHT users take a combined preparation because adequate dose and duration of progestogen is needed to prevent endometrial hyperplasia.68 The mode of delivery of MHT also affects the risk to benefit ratio. Transdermal MHT is as effective as oral MHT for vasomotor symptoms76 but a systematic review in 2018 found that transdermal MHT did not increase venous thromboembolic disease, although evidence quality was low to moderate.15,77,78 Decisions about how to take MHT should be shared, although patients sho",

The Monthly Index of Medical Specialities lists contraindications to MHT including oestrogen-sensitive cancer, history of venous thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism, active or recent arterial thromboembolic disease (eg, angina and myocardial infarction), acute liver disease, unexplained genital bleeding, pregnancy, elevated triglycerides, untreated hypertension, porphyria, and previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Recom­ mendations on the duration of MHT use vary, but in their 2022 guidelines, the North American Menopause Society cautions against starting MHT after age 60 years or beyond 10 years since menopause.56 However, the relative risks versus benefits of continuing MHT beyond age 60 years are uncertain and require a shared decision- making approach. Stopping MHT commonly leads to resurgent vasomotor symptoms in up to 50% of patients, and whether this resurgence reflects ongoing menopausal symptoms or a withdrawal effect from MHT is uncertain.79 Neither stopping MHT slowly nor stopping gradually have been shown to prevent resurgent symptoms.80 Shared decision making about treatment should consider the degree of symptom bother, personal preferences, cardiovascular disease and breast cancer risk, and uterine status (ie, having had a hysterectomy or not).72 Fracture risk increases after menopause and NICE indicates that 5 years of MHT reduces risk by 25 fractures per 1000 women on average (range nine to 37 fewer fractures per 1000 women).68 However, benefits dissipate by 5 years after MHT is discontinued.68,81 Therefore, 10 years of MHT from age 50 years to 60",

Although MHT is approved in some countries for the prevention of osteoporosis, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended in 2022 that MHT should not be used for the primary prevention of any chronic conditions solely because of the unfavourable risk versus benefit balance.82 In 2023, the Endocrine Society recommended that MHT only be used to prevent osteoporosis in those at substantial risk for whom other therapies are not tolerated or appropriate.72 For women with predominantly genitourinary symptoms, a 2021 meta-analysis reported that vaginal (topical) oestrogens can reduce dryness and prevent recurrent urinary tract infection.83 An RCT of daily intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone showed signifi­ cantly reduced dyspareunia and vaginal dryness at 12 weeks.84 Placebo-controlled RCTs have shown that ospemifene, a selective oestrogen receptor modulator, improves vaginal dryness and dyspareunia.85 However, there are no clinical trials directly comparing ospemifene with vaginal oestrogen, and published trials have focused on objective outcomes such as vaginal pH and the appearance of vaginal cells on microscopy, which are not priorities for symptomatic women or clinicians.71 Information about vaginal laser is still emerging, but RCTs in participants with and without breast cancer have shown no benefit over sham procedure for genitourinary symptom severity,86,87 stress incontinence,88 or sexual function.89 Shared decision making for genitourinary symptoms should include discussion of over-the-counter moisturisers and lubricants, vaginal oestrogen or dehydroepiandrosterone, and o",

Those seeking medical care are often looking for information rather than drug treatment unless their symptoms are severe.90 Women need easy access to unbiased, accurate information in a form they can understand, created without industry influence and without any hidden agendas to sell a drug or service.91 Accessing credible information can be challenging, particularly for women in LMICs where home remedies, ayurvedic, and homoeopathic therapies are often preferred to medical treatments for menopausal symptoms.33 Clinicians caring for patients with menopausal symptoms can empower and support them by listening with empathy, validating their experiences, and being aware of the social and cultural differences that can underlie those experiences (providing realistic and balanced information about the likely nature, severity, and duration of symptoms can be Series www.thelancet.com Vol 403 March 9, 2024 953 empowering for women and help them to make decisions about management (panel).

Menopausal symptoms commonly cluster, and patients experiencing clusters of hot flushes, disturbed sleep, and depressed mood might benefit from interventions that improve multiple symptoms, such as CBT, or non- hormonal treatments that benefit both vasomotor symptoms and depressed mood.58,93 A qualitative study of CBT for vasomotor symptoms reported that women felt empowered by learning to self-manage their symptoms, including greater knowledge about menopause, acceptance of their symptoms, and new coping strategies leading to greater confidence and a sense of control.94 Empowerment can directly improve the experience of menopause. A UK qualitative study reported the complex narrative of menopause as a normal event, a struggle, a loss of identity, and as a time of liberation and transformation.95 Unfortunately, many women seeking treatment for menopausal symptoms report feeling dismissed and receiving inaccurate information and ineffective treatments.96 Provision of realistic and impartial information is essential. For example, My Meno Plan was funded by the US NIH and developed without commercial input. It provides evidence-based information about typical changes over the menopause transition and postmeno­ pause and options for self-management and treatment.

No treatments are 100% effective, and counselling should be realistic about what improvements to expect and what side-effects can occur (for example, improvement of sleep, memory, and concentration with MHT only for those with problematic vasomotor symptoms73). Also, postmenopausal women considering combined MHT should be aware that up to 50% develop bleeding in the initial months, which might require investigation to rule out endometrial hyperplasia or cancer with ultrasound and potentially lead to hysteroscopy and biopsy.97 The effect of MHT on bleeding patterns in the perimenopause are not well understood, but intrauterine progestogen might offer better control of heavy bleeding compared with combined MHT.98 Women aged 45–55 years represent a highly productive group making an essential contribution to society and social structures. Women older than 40 years are the fastest growing sector of the paid workforce in HICs, and most essential and voluntary workers are women.99 Many are working during the menopause transition, and symptoms at work can be particularly problematic due to embarrassment and concerns about the reactions of other people. This situation can be particularly challenging for those working in informal economies and in LMICs. According to the UK Health and Safety Executive, women aged 45–54 years report more work- related stress than men or women of any other age group, associated with high job demands and inadequate control and support at work.100 These women have clearly indicated how things could improve. A qualitative study with 137 participants reported that women want their managers to be informed and empathetic about menopause and how symptoms might be exacerbated by the work environment.101 They also wanted their workplace to offer open and supportive communication and helpful work policies including flexible work hours.

Uniforms that are heavy or made of non-breathable fabric are an avoidable source of discomfort for menopausal women.102 Practical adjustments to support and empower menopausal women at work include informed and empathetic managers, fans, control of ambient air temperature, and uniforms made from breathable fabrics.8,100 Evidence from the UN (in 2023) and WHO (in 2021) reports that around 90% of people hold gender biases103 and more than 50% hold ageist attitudes.104 For older women experiencing menopause, these biases can intersect to reinforce negative attitudes and experiences. Clinicians can help by recognising these biases in themselves and avoiding framing menopause as a period of decay and decline (panel). Negative attitudes towards menopause can directly affect personal experiences. In 2010, a systematic review reported that women with neutral or positive attitudes towards menopause tended to have a greater sense of control than women with more negative attitudes.105 On the basis of a systematic review of qualitative studies, clinicians can offer reassurance that many women experience growing confidence and assertiveness, freedom from some responsibilities, shifts in family relationships, and accepting and embracing age.95,105 Future developments There is considerable variation between women in their experience of menopause and few ways to predict who might have symptoms and for how long.

There is clearly a need for more evidence-based strategies to relieve menopausal symptoms, which requires a skilled workforce to provide clinical care. Ageism is a powerful social determinant of health, and in countries where menopause is equated with physical and mental decline, it is not surprising that many find this transition daunting. Actively challenging ageism and encouraging a more positive discourse can help reduce For more on My Meno Plan see https://mymenoplan.org/ Series 954 www.thelancet.com Vol 403 March 9, 2024 anxiety for women approaching menopause.92 The social value of older women can affect this experience. In contexts in which women’s value is predicated on reproduction, menopause tends to reduce social status. By contrast, in societies in which ageing confers respect, such as in Indigenous communities in Australia, menopause is considered less problematic.106 Growing public discourse about menopause in some settings (eg, the UK) is raising awareness and could help change the culture by reducing stigma and shame and encouraging open discussion. Women have indicated that they want this topic to come out of the shadows and be more openly discussed, particularly in the workplace. They want their experiences heard by each other and their health-care providers.91 Public initiatives aiming to empower women by dispelling myths, sharing realistic experiences, and promoting positive images include Menopause Café, and arts initiatives such as Flesh after Fifty directly challenge negative beliefs and create new positive role models.",

Digital health, including use of mobile health apps, telemedicine, and data analytics to improve health systems, surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. New tools are emerging that are designed to empower women to recognise, understand, and manage their own menopausal symptoms through digital technology. For example, Henpicked menopause hub and Women Living Better provide evidence-based, realistic, and clear information about the menopause transition and its symptoms, including stories from women with lived experience and information about treatment options. Women can use the My Meno Plan tool to compare treatments and develop their own management approach in consultation with their health-care provider. Much information about menopause available online is driven by commercial interests. The National Library of Medicine tool can be used for evaluating the quality of online health information. People in LMICs can benefit from proactive information from health-care providers about what to expect at menopause. In 2021, a European consensus recommended that workplaces should create an open, inclusive, and supportive culture around menopause, with occupational health professionals and human resource managers working together.8 To enable employers to make these changes, online resources such as Menopause at Work provide evidence-based and practical information for employers to support their employees, including education, communication, and flexible work policies.

Despite substantial gaps in knowledge about menopause, research has largely focused on developing new drugs for vasomotor symptoms, although most women do not choose to take medication. Interpretation of these clinical trials has been hindered by inadequate agreed patient-reported outcome measures and inconsistent measures for the same symptom,107 which For more on the National Library of Medicine tool see https://medlineplus.gov/ webeval/webeval.html For Menopause at Work see https://www.menopauseatwork. org/ limits comparisons between treatments and precludes data pooling.

Little is known about the diversity of experience across LMICs, and what is known suggests that the differences are greater than the similarities.109 In addition, women have not been widely consulted about their priorities for menopause research.

    "[INTRODUCTION] NAMS POSITION STATEMENT Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of The North American Menopause Society Abstract Objective: To review evidence regarding osteoporosis screening, prevention, diagnosis, and management in the past decade and update the position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2010 regarding the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women as new therapies and paradigms have become available. Design: NAMS enlisted a panel of clinician experts in the field of metabolic bone diseases and/or women’s health to review and update the 2010 NAMS position statement and recommendations on the basis of new evidence and clinical judgement. The panel’s recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Results: Osteoporosis, especially prevalent in older postmenopausal women, increases the risk of fractures that can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Postmenopausal bone loss, related to estrogen deficiency, is the primary contributor to osteoporosis. Other important risk factors for postmenopausal osteoporosis include advanced age, genetics, smoking, thinness, and many diseases and drugs that impair bone health. An evaluation of these risk factors to identify candidates for osteoporosis screening and recommending nonpharmaco- logic measures such as good nutrition (especially adequate intake of protein, calcium, and vitamin D), regular physical activity, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are appropriate for all postmenopausal women. For women at high risk for osteoporosis, especially perimenopausal women with low bone density and other risk factors, estrogen or other therapies are available to prevent bone loss. For women with osteoporosis and/or other risk factors for fracture, including advanced age and previous fractures, the primary goal of therapy is to prevent new fractures.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] imenopausal women with low bone density and other risk factors, estrogen or other therapies are available to prevent bone loss. For women with osteoporosis and/or other risk factors for fracture, including advanced age and previous fractures, the primary goal of therapy is to prevent new fractures. This is accomplished by combining nonpharmacologic measures, drugs to increase bone density and to improve bone strength, and strategies to reduce fall risk. If pharmacologic therapy is indicated, government- approved options include estrogen agonists/antagonists, bisphosphonates, RANK ligand inhibitors, parathyroid hormone-receptor agonists, and inhibitors of sclerostin. Conclusions: Osteoporosis is a common disorder in postmenopausal women. Management of skeletal health in postmenopausal women involves assessing risk factors for fracture, reducing modifiable risk factors through dietary and lifestyle changes, and the use of pharmacologic therapy for patients at significant risk of osteoporosis or fracture. For women with osteoporosis, lifelong management is necessary. Treatment decisions occur continuously over the lifespan of a postmenopausal woman. Decisions must be individualized and should include the patient in the process of shared decision-making.

    "[INTRODUCTION] s position statements on specific disorders to provide reliable and accurate information regarding management of meno- pause-associated health conditions. Here, NAMS provides guidance on the diagnosis, assessment, prevention, and treat- ment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women in North America. The recommendations herein are based, where possible, on evidence provided by clinical trials and, where evidence does not exist, current best clinical practice in the opinions and clinical judgment of an editorial panel consisting of clinicians and researchers with expertise in metabolic bone diseases or women’s health. These statements do not represent guidelines or codified practice standards as defined by regulating bodies and insurance agencies. Rather, the editorial panel has attempted to provide sufficient information for clinicians to approach postmenopausal women with or at risk for osteopo- rosis with a confident understanding of management options. The recommendations are focused on the perceptions of the needs of healthcare professionals caring for the skeletal health of postmenopausal women in the primary care setting. The guidance provided herein is generally consistent with recom- mendations for the assessment and treatment of postmeno- pausal osteoporosis available from several other North American societies and organizations.2-8 This position statement is an update of the 2010 position statement, ‘‘Management of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women.’’9 Since then, several new medications with sophis- ticated mechanisms of action have received government approval on the basis of randomized, controlled trial (RCT) data.

These advances have created the need to update the position statement. METHODS For this revision, NAMS enlisted a six-person editorial panel composed of clinicians and researchers with expertise in metabolic bone diseases or women’s health to review the 2010 position statement, identify key studies and evidence pub- lished subsequently, and reach consensus on recommenda- tions. The editorial panel reviewed clinical studies published in English related to osteoporosis management in postmen- opausal women. Priority was given to evidence from RCTs and meta-analyses of such trials, followed by evidence from systematic reviews and controlled observational studies, using criteria described elsewhere.10 Because standards of care and available treatment options differ throughout the world, the focus is limited to therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis available in North America. The NAMS Board of Trustees was responsible for the final review and approval of this position statement. EVALUATING PATIENTS FOR AND WITH OSTEOPOROSIS Background Osteoporosis—the most common bone disorder affecting humans—is a generalized skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength, predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture, most importantly of the spine and hip.11 These and other serious fractures occur most commonly in older postmenopausal women and are often life-altering events. However, the bone loss that results in osteoporosis is most marked during the menopause transition and early menopause.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] risk of fracture, most importantly of the spine and hip.11 These and other serious fractures occur most commonly in older postmenopausal women and are often life-altering events. However, the bone loss that results in osteoporosis is most marked during the menopause transition and early menopause. Less serious fractures, such as wrist fractures, occur in young postmenopausal women and are important warning signs of osteoporosis. Persons with osteoporosis and high risk of fracture can be readily identified. Both general and pharmacologic manage- ment strategies are available to slow or prevent bone loss and to reduce fracture risk. Because osteoporosis is such a com- mon disorder, skeletal health assessment should be a part of the routine evaluation of all postmenopausal women, and all professionals caring for postmenopausal women should be competent and confident about undertaking that evaluation. Pathophysiology In adults, bone tissue undergoes constant change by a process called bone remodeling. Old bone material (mineral and protein matrix) is resorbed (removed) by osteoclasts and replaced with new healthy bone by osteoblasts. Osteocytes interconnect in the solid matrix of bone via an extensive canalicular network that senses both mechanical loading and focal bone damage. Osteocytes secrete molecules that regu- late both the location of and the rate of bone remodeling. These include receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-b (RANK) ligand, a growth-promoting factor whose interaction with its receptor RANK is required for the proliferation, differentiation, and activity of osteoclasts; and sclerostin, an inhibitor of bone formation. Osteocyte activity is, in turn, regulated by mechanical loading and circulating hormones including parathyroid hormone (PTH) and estrogen.",

Osteocyte activity is, in turn, regulated by mechanical loading and circulating hormones including parathyroid hormone (PTH) and estrogen. Bone strength (and, hence, fracture risk) is dependent on many qualities of bone, of which bone mineral density (BMD) is the most commonly measured.11 Bone density at any given age is a function of both peak bone mass (reached by age 30) and how much bone is subsequently lost. In healthy premen- opausal women, bone mass is quite stable. The amount of old bone resorbed is replaced with an almost equal amount of new bone.12 During perimenopause, estrogen deficiency results in increased expression of RANK ligand, activating osteoclasts. Bone resorption becomes more rapid, exceeding the ability of NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 974 Menopause, Vol. 28, No. 9, 2021 \u0002 2021 The North American Menopause Society osteoblasts to form new bone, resulting in an accelerated phase of bone loss during the menopause transition.12,13 The average annual rate of bone loss is about 2%, beginning 1 to 3 years before menopause and lasting for 5 to 10 years, resulting in an average loss of BMD of 10% to 12% in the spine and hip across the menopause transition.12 Rates of loss are somewhat greater in thin versus heavy women. After this interval of relatively rapid bone loss, bone density decreases about 0.5% per year. This imbalance in remodeling continues into advanced age in which an additional deficit in osteoblast function limits bone formation. By age 80 years, women have lost, on average, approximately 30% of their peak bone mass.4 Bone loss after menopause results in a gradual but progres- sive deterioration of the microarchitecture of both trabecular and cortical bone, weakening the skeleton and increasing the risk of fracture.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] mation. By age 80 years, women have lost, on average, approximately 30% of their peak bone mass.4 Bone loss after menopause results in a gradual but progres- sive deterioration of the microarchitecture of both trabecular and cortical bone, weakening the skeleton and increasing the risk of fracture. The thick and numerous trabeculae seen in the spine and ends of long bones in premenopausal women become thinned and perforated and may be completely resorbed, result- ing in empty spaces where bone tissue once existed. The thick outer shell of cortical bone is thinned from the inside and becomes more porous because of the dominance of bone resorption over formation. This imbalance in bone remodeling can be accentuated by a very sedentary lifestyle, contributing to accelerated bone loss in older inactive women. Many diseases and medications can amplify these effects by either increasing bone resorption or inhibiting bone formation. Other factors, including bone mineralization, matrix com- position, microstructure, and microdamage, as well as age- related factors such as the accumulation of advanced glyca- tion end products, affect the quality and integrity of bone tissue. These factors cannot be directly measured in clinical practice. These combined changes in bone mass, structure, and quality result in impaired bone strength and the increased fracture risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Bone mineral density The measurement of areal bone density (the amount of bone mineral divided by the area of the bone scanned) by dual- energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), is the principal clinical tool used to assess skeletal health. Careful attention to the quality of both the acquisition and interpretation of DXA bone density tests is necessary.14 To standardize bone density values from different skeletal sites, results are reported as T-scores or Z-scores: \u0002 The T-score compares a woman’s bone density to the average value of healthy young women and is expressed in standard deviation",
    "[INTRODUCTION] d interpretation of DXA bone density tests is necessary.14 To standardize bone density values from different skeletal sites, results are reported as T-scores or Z-scores: \u0002 The T-score compares a woman’s bone density to the average value of healthy young women and is expressed in standard deviation (SD) units. A T-score of þ1 repre- sents a value 1 SD above the young normal mean, whereas a value 2.5 SDs below the young normal mean would equate to a T-score of \u00032.5. By convention, the White (non-race adjusted), young, normal value serves as the reference for T-scores in women of all races. \u0002 The Z-score is the number of SDs above or below the average bone density for the average person of the same age, sex, and ethnicity. The normal range for Z-score is \u00032.0 to þ2.0. The Z-score has limited value in postmenopausal women. Studies to date provide inadequate data on racial inequities in health care. Individual- and system-level issues that pro- mote inequality need to be addressed in further research studies.15 Diagnosing osteoporosis Diagnostic categorization by bone density is based on recommendations of a World Health Organization Study Group (for the diagnosis of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women is a T-score of \u00032.5 or less at the lumbar spine (LS; at least two vertebral levels measured in the posterior-anterior projection but not the lateral projection), femoral neck (FN), or total hip (TH) by DXA testing. If anatomic factors such as arthritis or hip replacement make measurements of the spine and hip invalid, bone density of the distal one-third site of the radius (forearm) may be considered a diagnostic site, but other methods of diagnosing osteoporosis and assessing fracture risk also should be considered. When a woman’s T-score increases with treatment from less than \u00032.5 to values above \u00032.5, the diagnosis of osteoporosis persists.17 The diagnosis of low BMD, or osteopenia, does not nec- essarily indicate that bone loss has occurred.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] teoporosis and assessing fracture risk also should be considered. When a woman’s T-score increases with treatment from less than \u00032.5 to values above \u00032.5, the diagnosis of osteoporosis persists.17 The diagnosis of low BMD, or osteopenia, does not nec- essarily indicate that bone loss has occurred. This term has limited clinical use because it includes young postmenopausal women without other risk factors who are at low risk of fracture as well as older women with other risk factors who are at very high risk of fracture. T-scores can be generated from other methods of BMD assessment, and some of those measurements have been shown to predict fracture risk. In general, however, T-scores from those other methods should not be used to diagnose osteoporosis.18 In addition to BMD, the clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis can be made in postmenopausal women who present with fractures of their spine or hip or who have other risk factors resulting in high fracture risk ( Osteoporosis is categorized as either primary or secondary. Primary osteoporosis refers to bone loss that occurs after menopause and with aging. Secondary osteoporosis is diag- nosed when medications such as glucocorticoids or diseases contribute to bone loss. Prevalence In the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examina- tion Survey, 16.5% of American women aged 50 years or older had osteoporosis, defined as a BMD T-score of \u00032.5 or lower at either the FN or LS.19 Similar prevalence has been observed in Canada and Mexico.20,21 The prevalence of osteoporosis by low FN BMD increases with age, from Normal T-score \u0004 \u00031.0 Low bone massa T-score between 1.0 and \u00032.5 Osteoporosis T-score \u0005 \u00032.5 aThis category is often referred to as osteopenia.

However, recent data suggest that those rates have plateaued and may even be increasing again, perhaps related to the declining use of osteoporosis medications since 2008.29,30 The absolute number of patients who have fractures will continue to increase because of population growth.22 Morbidity and mortality Hip fractures, occurring on average at age 82, elicit a particularly devastating toll, resulting in higher cost and disability than all other fracture types combined.31 Hip frac- tures cause up to a 25% increase in mortality within 1",

The annual incidence of experiencing a second hip fracture is 2% to 10%, with the second fracture occurring, on average, about 2 years after the first.33 Fractures at other sites, including the spine, humerus, and pelvis, also can result in serious morbidity.34 Multiple or severe vertebral fractures may cause substantial pain as well as loss of height and exaggerated curvature of the thoracic spine (kyphosis), restricted movement, and impaired lung function.35 Only about one-third of vertebral fractures that can be diagnosed radiographically come to clinical atten- tion.35,36 Existing vertebral fractures increase the risk of subsequent vertebral fracture by five- to seven-fold.37 The relative risk for mortality after vertebral fracture is as high as with hip fracture.38 Postfracture pain, loss of mobility, changed body image, and loss of independence can have strong effects on self-esteem and mood.39 Clinical assessment Evaluation of skeletal health, including the assessment of risk factors for low BMD and fracture, should be undertaken in all postmenopausal women. This information can identify women for BMD testing and shape recommendations for clinical management.

Major risk factors for low BMD in postmenopausal women include menopause status, advanced age, genetics, thinness, and diseases or drugs with adverse skeletal effects. Low BMD, as well as a history of previous fracture, older age, parental history of hip fracture, frailty, and other medical problems are important risk factors for fracture. Tools to assess the risk of low BMD and of osteoporotic fracture are available. Risk factors for low bone density. \u0002 Advanced age. Bone loss decreases progressively with advancing age, and the prevalence of osteoporosis increases as women grow older. \u0002 Thinness. Bone density in healthy women is strongly correlated with body weight.40 Being thin—often cited as body weight less than 127 lb (57.7 kg), the lower quartile of weight for US women aged older than 65 years, or body mass index (BMI) less than 21 kg/m2—is a risk factor for low BMD. \u0002 Genetics. Family studies demonstrate that 50% to 85% of the variance in BMD is genetically determined.41 Many genes have been weakly associated with low bone mass in humans. \u0002 Smoking. Women who currently smoke have lower BMD than do nonsmokers.42 Smokers are generally thinner and have earlier menopause and lower serum estradiol levels than nonsmokers. \u0002 Diseases and drugs. Many diseases and drugs adversely affect the skeleton (orders, chronic inflammatory illnesses (ie, rheumatoid arthritis), diseases causing malabsorption (ie, celiac dis- ease), and various endocrinopathies (hyperparathyroidism, Cushing syndrome). Drugs can cause bone loss by increas- ing bone resorption (aromatase inhibitors [AIs]), impairing vitamin D metabolism (phenytoin), or reducing bone for- mation (glucocorticoids), as can surgeries such as gastric bypass.

Tools to predict low bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. Several simple tools are available to identify postmeno- pausal women likely to have low BMD. The Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool combines age and body weight in this formula: Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool T-score ¼ 0.2 \u0006 (weight in kg minus age in years), truncated to yield integer.43 Using a definition of less than 2 as high risk, the performance of the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool in identifying postmenopausal White women with BMD T-score values of \u00032.5 or lower at either the LS or FN demonstrated a sensitivity of 95.3% and a corresponding specificity of 39.6%.",

The Osteoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument demonstrated sensitivity of 93.3% and 94.4% for selecting Canadian women with low BMD and osteoporosis, respectively.44 These tools are most useful for selecting young postmenopausal women for BMD testing. Risk factors for fracture. The most important risk factors for fracture in postmeno- pausal women are history of previous fracture or falls, older age, and low BMD. Combining these and other independent risk factors improves the ability to identify patients at high risk of fracture.45 Several fracture risk-assessment tools are available to estimate a person’s risk of fracture, including the Canadian Association of Radiologists and Osteoporosis Canada calculator.46 This computer-based algorithm is available online (www.sheffield.ac.uk/FRAX/) and in com- mon DXA software. In addition to age, sex, and BMI, FRAX combines age, sex, BMI, and independent risk factors on the basis of meta-analyses of large observational cohorts (risk in White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic women in the United States. Details of the use of the FRAX tool, including its strengths and limitations, have been reviewed elsewhere.48 \u0002 Prior fracture. Having or having had a fracture since menopause is the most important and powerful risk factor for having another fracture.49 The risk of refracture is especially high (up to 19% within 12 mo) in patients with recent fractures.37,50 This has led some organizations to describe patients with a recent osteoporotic fracture as being at very high or imminent risk of fracture.7,51 This increased risk gradually diminishes but persists for at least 10 years, with the average risk over that time being about two-fold higher t",

The strongest correlation of BMD and fracture risk is with hip bone density.53 Hip fracture risk increases by 2.6-fold for each age-adjusted SD (one Z- score unit) decrease in FN BMD. The magnitude of risk associated with low BMD is modulated by age and other risk factors.

For any BMD value, older women are at higher fracture risk than are younger postmenopausal women.45 \u0002 Parental history of hip fracture. The strongest compo- nent of a family history to predict fracture risk is a parental history of hip fracture.54 \u0002 Smoking. Fracture risk in postmenopausal women who smoke is increased about 30%, independent of BMD.55 \u0002 Excessive alcohol intake. Consuming more than three servings of alcohol daily is associated with a 38% and 68% increase risk of major osteoporotic and hip fracture, respectively.56 Risk factors not incorporated into FRAX include those not available in the databases on which FRAX was based (eg, falls) or were not known when FRAX was developed (diabe- tes): \u0002 Falls. Most fractures, including many vertebral fractures, occur after a fall from a standing height or less.57,58 As a result, risk factors for falls, including a history of recent falls; weakness; impaired balance, coordination, vision, or hearing; obesity; and arthritis, are also risk factors for fracture. \u0002 Diseases and drugs.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] many vertebral fractures, occur after a fall from a standing height or less.57,58 As a result, risk factors for falls, including a history of recent falls; weakness; impaired balance, coordination, vision, or hearing; obesity; and arthritis, are also risk factors for fracture. \u0002 Diseases and drugs. Poor health is a risk factor for fracture; most diseases are associated with a general increase in fracture risk (such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased fracture risk without causing bone loss. Disorders and drugs that affect muscle strength and balance such as frailty, stroke, and antidepressant medications increase risks of falls and fracture. Other known risk factors for fracture include dementia, low physical activity, thoracic kyphosis, rates of bone loss, and both weight and height loss.52,59 Other risk-assessment methods. Bone density can be assessed by techniques other than DXA, including ultrasound and quantitative computed tomography (CT). T-score values obtained with these tech- niques are not substitutes for T-scores of the hip or spine obtained with DXA because they may overestimate or under- estimate BMD and thus fracture risk.60 For those few patients who cannot have DXA measurements at the hip or spine, assessing fracture risk with FRAX without BMD provides more useful information than does BMD measured by alternate techniques. Biomechanical CT analyzes quantitative CT scans of the LS and hip with an algorithm called finite element analysis that provides validated estimates of bone strength in individ- ual patients.61 Biomechanical CT predicts fracture risk, although its advantage over DXA is small. Access to bio- mechanical CT is limited, and its role in routine clinical practice has not been defined. Trabecular bone score is a special software available for DXA machines that analyzes the heterogeneity of density distribution on routine LS DXA images.",

Trabecular bone score is a special software available for DXA machines that analyzes the heterogeneity of density distribution on routine LS DXA images. Trabecular bone score measurements correlate with trabecular microarchitec- ture and predict fracture risk independently from bone den- sity.62 Trabecular bone score has recently been incorporated into FRAX.63 Using trabecular bone score is most helpful in women whose fracture risk is near the treatment threshold. Assessing fall risk, with special emphasis on a history of a recent fall, is an important part of risk assessment in older women.57 The Stopping Elderly Accidents Deaths and Injury initiative developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides an algorithm for fall-risk screening (www.cdc.gov/steadi/pdf/STEADI-Algorithm-508.pdf). Limitations to fracture-risk assessment. There are limitations to the use of any of the individual fracture-risk assessment tools and of the FRAX assessment tool. FRAX underestimates fracture risk in patients with falls or diabetes and in those with low spine but not FN BMD.64 In addition, current FRAX scoring does not allow input for quantification of risk factors, including dose of glucocorti- coid, amount of alcohol intake, duration and amount of cigarette smoking, or the number, type, or recency of prior fractures.47 Despite these limitations, FRAX has been vali- dated as an accurate predictor of fracture probability in large populations in the United States and Canada.65,66 However, its performance in identifying individual patients who will or will not fracture is less robust.67 FRAX does not accurately predict BMD, but that is not what it was designed to do.68 Until there are practical and inexpensive methods to measure bone strength accurately, estimating fracture risk with FRAX will remain one of the most usefu",

Physical examination The goals of evaluating postmenopausal women with oste- oporosis or important risk factors are to identify modifiable risk factors and secondary causes of bone loss, to quantify fracture risk and the severity of osteoporosis, and to determine appropriate candidates for pharmacologic therapy. This eval- uation requires a detailed history of risk factors for fractures and falls, other diseases and medications, previous fractures, and family history. A thorough physical examination should include evaluation of kyphosis, muscle strength, and balance. Standing height should be measured annually with an accurate method, such as a wall-mounted ruler or a stadiometer. Height loss of 1.5 in (3.8 cm) or more increases the likelihood that a vertebral fracture is present. This calls for evaluation by a lateral thoracolumbar radiograph or vertebral fracture assess- ment by DXA to identify asymptomatic compression verte- bral fractures.71,72 Weight should be recorded to identify those women with low BMI and to be aware of weight changes, which may interfere with the interpretation of changes in BMD over time.

For women with osteoporosis, examination also should include specific skeletal assessments such as bone tenderness (best elicited over the anterior tibia or thoracic vertebrae), indicating osteomalacia or focal bone disease, and joint laxity or blue sclera, features of osteogene- sis imperfecta. Laboratory evaluation For women with osteoporosis considering pharmacologic therapy, laboratory testing is performed to evaluate for sec- ondary causes of bone loss and to identify contraindications to specific therapies (plete blood cell count and general serum chemistry, especially serum calcium, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and serum phosphate. Measurement of 24-hour urinary calcium excretion is useful to detect patients with poor calcium absorption (<100 mg/d) and those with hypercalciuria (>250 mg/d). Special laboratory tests should be considered in the presence of abnormal routine laboratory tests, clinical clues of other diseases, or unusual cases of osteoporosis. Biochemical markers of bone turnover. Bone turnover markers are serum tests that reflect either bone resorption by osteoclasts (fasting serum C-telopeptide of type I collagen) or bone formation by osteoblasts (bone- specific alkaline phosphatase or serum procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide).73 Bone turnover markers cannot diagnose osteoporosis and have varying ability to predict Diagnostic result Possible secondary cause Routine tests Complete blood count Anemia Multiple myeloma; celiac disease Elevated Hyperparathyroidism Serum calcium Lowa Vitamin D deficiency; GI malabsorption; hypoparathyroidism Serum albumin (used to interpret serum calcium) Low Nutritional deficiencies; renal protein loss Serum phosphate Elevated Renal failure Low Hyperparathyroidism; renal phosphate wasting Serum creatinine Elevatedb Renal failure; osteodystrophy Serum alkaline phosphatase Elevated Vitamin D deficiency; GI malabsorption; liver/biliary tract disease; Paget disease Low Hypophosphatasia Special test",

NONPHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENTS AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS The objectives of managing skeletal health in postmeno- pausal women are to prevent or minimize bone loss and to reduce the likelihood of fractures. All postmenopausal women, regardless of their BMD, clinical risk factors, or fracture risk, should be encouraged to adopt nonpharmaco- logic measures and lifestyle modifications, such as eating a balanced diet with adequate intakes of calcium and vitamin D, being physically active, and avoiding harmful lifestyle habits such as smoking, to support both general and bone health.4,5,7,75 These general approaches, however, will not prevent bone loss in early menopause, will not significantly increase BMD in postmenopausal women, and are certainly not adequate treatment for women with osteoporosis.",

For women at high risk of fracture, pharmacologic therapy to strengthen the skeleton is required to reduce fracture risk. With obvious exceptions, such as the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), most studies evaluating the effects of non- pharmacologic treatments and lifestyle modification are small and of short duration. As a result, recommendations here will be based on systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and expert opinion. Nutrition Calcium and vitamin D Sufficient intakes of calcium and vitamin D are necessary for normal skeletal growth during childhood and adolescence. The importance of these nutrients in healthy postmenopausal women is less clear. An Institute of Medicine (IOM; now called the National Academy of Medicine) committee con- cluded that scientific evidence supports important roles for calcium and vitamin D in skeletal health. Their proposed daily intakes of calcium for postmenopausal women were 1,000 mg to 1,200 mg, with an upper limit of 2,000 mg (IOM commented that the recommendation for women aged 51 to 70 years is based on uncertain and inconsistent data. The average dietary calcium intake in postmenopausal women in the United States and Canada is 700 mg to 800 mg, about one-third of which comes from dairy products, meaning that an average dairy-free diet contains up to 500 mg of calcium. Few healthy women need to take more than 50 mg to 600 mg of a calcium supplement to achieve the IOM- recommended daily intake. Patients with malabsorption or disorders of calcium metabolism such as hypoparathyroidism may require higher daily intakes of calcium and vitamin D.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] p to 500 mg of calcium. Few healthy women need to take more than 50 mg to 600 mg of a calcium supplement to achieve the IOM- recommended daily intake. Patients with malabsorption or disorders of calcium metabolism such as hypoparathyroidism may require higher daily intakes of calcium and vitamin D. A listing of calcium content of foods and supplements is avail- able from the National Institutes of Health Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases National Resource Center (www. bones.nih.gov/health-info/bone/bone-health/nutrition/calcium- and-vitamin-d-important-every-age). No serious adverse events (AEs) have been observed with daily calcium intakes of less than 600 mg. Larger daily intakes are associated with gastrointestinal symptoms including bloating and constipation. In the WHI Calcium and Vitamin D study, the average dietary calcium intake was about 1,100mg daily. In the group that took an additional 1,000mg of a calcium supplement daily, the risk of kidney stones was increased by 17%.77 The possi- bility that a calcium supplement of 1,000mg daily (with total daily intake approximately 2,000mg) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk was raised in a clinical trial and a subsequent meta-analysis.78,79 That association was not observed in the WHI.80 A subsequent meta-analysis found that a calcium intake level of 2,000mg to 2,500mg per day was not associated with cardiovascular risk in healthy adults.81 However, in the absence of proof of benefit, a total daily calcium intake of more than 1,200mg is not recommended for healthy postmenopausal women or those with osteoporosis. of calcium and vitamin D for women aged older than 50 years Calcium, mg Vitamin D, IU Age range, y EARa RDAb EARa RDAb 51-70 1,000 1,200 400 600 Over 70 1,000 1,200 400 800 EAR, estimated average requirement; IU, international units, RDA, recommended dietary allowance. aExpected to satisfy the needs of 50% of persons in that age group.",

The IOM recommends 600 IU for women aged between 50 and 70 years and 800 IU daily for those aged older than 70 years, stating that these intakes were sufficient to achieve serum 25-OHD levels of at least 20 ng/mL in most postmenopausal women. Meta-analyses of the effects of calcium and/or vitamin D on fracture risk provide inconsistent conclusions, with most reporting no benefit on fracture risk.82,83 In the bone health substudy in the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial, the bone density effects of 2,000 IU of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) daily were evaluated over 24 months in healthy women (average age, 63 y) with baseline serum 25-OHD levels of 27.6 ng/mL.84 No effect was observed in the entire study group or in the subgroup with baseline serum 25-OHD levels less than 30 ng/mL. The inability to demonstrate effectiveness may be related to calcium and vitamin D being threshold nutrients; severe deficiencies may be harmful, but intakes more than the threshold to avoid deficiency does not provide additional benefit.

    "[INTRODUCTION] e additional benefit. Salutary effects of vitamin D with calcium on fracture risk have been observed most often in institutionalized or vitamin D-deficient older adults.85 Most studies evaluating the effects of calcium or vitamin D have not restricted the study population to deficient participants. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that there was insufficient evidence to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of daily supplementation with vitamin D 400 IU or more and calcium 1,000 mg or more daily for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmeno- pausal women.86 They also recommended against the use of vitamin D supplements to prevent falls.87 Women with osteoporosis do not require more calcium than women with normal BMD, and there is no convincing evi- dence that taking calcium and vitamin D supplements improves the effectiveness of osteoporosis drugs.88 Adequate intakes of calcium and vitamin D are recommended when taking osteoporosis drugs to reduce the risk of treatment- induced hypocalcemia.5 Protein intake Studies of relationships between protein intake and BMD or fracture risk have been inconsistent. In fall-prone older adults who were losing weight, higher protein intake was associated with reduced fall frequency.89 Probiotics The gut microbiota can influence several aspects of bone health, including the absorption of calcium and vitamin D and immune response. In animal models, probiotics may prevent bone loss associated with estrogen deficiency, and prelimi- nary studies in humans suggest that probiotics could have a role in preventing bone loss.90 Other supplements Strontium is a heavier divalent cation than calcium and increases BMD by being deposited in the skeleton.",

Strontium ranelate, a proprietary strontium salt, reduced the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.91 This drug was never approved in the United States or Canada, and it is no longer available in the rest of the world because of concerns about increased cardiovascular risk. Other strontium salts (citrate, chloride) are promoted to support bone health in the United States, but there is no evidence for their effectiveness or safety. Meta-analysis found no meaningful relationship between magnesium intake and skeletal health.92 Routine magnesium supplementation is not recommended in healthy adults with normal diets. Various vitamin K supplements have been promoted to improve bone health. A recent meta-analysis found no evi- dence that vitamin K affects bone density or vertebral fracture risk in postmenopausal women and that the evidence was insufficient to confirm a reduction in clinical fractures.93 Phytoestrogens, including isoflavones, are plant-derived compounds with weak estrogenic activity. In a systematic review, some isoflavones (aglycone form) had a moderately beneficial effect against estrogen-deficiency bone loss.94 Isoflavones are not recommended as effective strategies to prevent or treat postmenopausal osteoporosis.95 There is also no compelling evidence for a beneficial effect of boron, zinc, black cohosh, berberine, or dehydroepiandros- terone on BMD or fracture risk in postmenopausal women.

    "[INTRODUCTION] ere is also no compelling evidence for a beneficial effect of boron, zinc, black cohosh, berberine, or dehydroepiandros- terone on BMD or fracture risk in postmenopausal women. Avoiding harmful lifestyle factors Cessation of smoking and limiting alcohol intake are important general health measures. The AEs of smoking on bone health appear to reverse when smoking is stopped.96 Physical activity and exercise Skeletal mass is strongly influenced by mechanical loading. During growth in children, impact-loading exercise programs induce small gains in BMD, whereas diseases causing immo- bilization are associated with low bone mass. A Cochrane review and several meta-analyses found relatively small, statistically significant effects of exercise on BMD compared with control groups in postmenopausal women.97-99 The perception that exercise can reverse osteoporosis in postmenopausal women by inducing new bone formation is unfounded. Programs of regular exercise for general health can be recommended, especially those that increase muscle strength and improve balance, leading to fewer falls. Women with osteoporosis, especially those with vertebral fractures, should avoid activities that involve lifting or pulling with forward spine flexion or rotation and may benefit from an exercise program to stretch and strengthen the extensor muscles of the spine.100 Fall prevention At least one-third of women aged 65 years and older experience one or more falls each year, and the risk of falling and of fracture increases with advancing age.101 Because most fractures occur as a result of a fall, attempts to reduce the NAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, Vol. 28, No. 9, 2021 981 incidence of falls should be important components of reduc- ing fracture risk in older postmenopausal women.4,7 A recent USPSTF report and a Cochrane review found that multicom- ponent exercise programs such as tai chi that target balance, gait, and muscle strength were the most effective ways to prevent falls and per",

Hip protectors may be considered in patients at high risk for falling, especially for patients in supervised settings such as long-term care facilities.102 The Centers for Disease Con- trol and Prevention’s Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries initiative, based on published guidelines, provides useful tools for fall risk assessment and management (www.cdc.gov/steadi/). Key points \u0002 Recommending and promoting healthy habits, including attention to nutrition, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, physical activity, and avoidance of harmful habits is appropriate for all postmenopausal women. \u0002 None of these approaches can significantly improve BMD or correct the architectural abnormalities of osteoporosis. \u0002 The modest skeletal benefits of nonpharmacologic mea- sures should not be construed as sufficient or effective therapies for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture. \u0002 The likelihood of falls can be decreased, however, and fracture risk may be reduced in older women. Prevention of falls is especially important in older women or those with decreased mobility. PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY TO PREVENT BONE LOSS Several drugs with differing mechanisms of action have demonstrated the ability to prevent bone loss in postmeno- pausal women and to reduce fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. The mechanisms of action of all osteoporosis drugs are to modulate (either to inhibit or to activate) bone metabolism.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] h differing mechanisms of action have demonstrated the ability to prevent bone loss in postmeno- pausal women and to reduce fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. The mechanisms of action of all osteoporosis drugs are to modulate (either to inhibit or to activate) bone metabolism. Antiremodeling agents, often called antiresorptive drugs, include estrogen, estrogen ago- nists/antagonists (EAAs), bisphosphonates, and denosumab. They inhibit bone resorption, and to a lesser extent, bone formation. These drugs maintain or improve BMD and reduce fracture risk, but they do not improve or repair disruption of trabecular structure. In contrast, osteoanabolic agents, by stimulating new bone formation, improve cortical and/or trabecular bone structure and induce large increases in BMD, reducing fractures more quickly than do antiremodel- ing drugs. Prevention versus treatment Drugs are approved by North American regulatory agencies for either preventing or treating osteoporosis or both. Since 2008, North American guidelines have focused on using osteoporosis drugs to reduce fracture risk. The concept of preventing osteoporosis by halting postmenopausal bone loss and its attendant damage to skeletal architecture is not recog- nized in those guidelines. On the basis of studies demonstrating prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women without osteoporosis, various oral and transdermal estrogen preparations, alone or in com- bination with progestogens or bazedoxifene (BZA), as well as raloxifene, tibolone (in Mexico only), and four bisphospho- nate drugs (alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledr- onate) have government approval for prevention of osteoporosis (over 2 years in prevention studies are varied.

The bone density benefits of therapy persist as long as therapy is continued, but the effects of estrogen-like drugs abate when treatment is discontinued. Markers of bone turnover return to pretreatment values within a few months, and BMD falls to pretreatment levels within 1 to 2 years of stopping therapy, effects pre- vented by switching to a bisphosphonate.103,104 Although using drugs to prevent osteoporosis is not included in national osteoporosis guidelines, a strong clinical argument can be made for doing so, especially in women who come to menopause with low bone mass.105,106 On average, women lose about one T-score unit (10-12%) of bone mass across a normal menopause transition.12,107,108 With this rapid bone loss, significant and irreversible deterioration in trabec- ular microarchitecture occurs. These effects are preventable with estrogen and bisphosphonates.106,109,110 However, with the exception of the WHI, strong evidence that preventing bone loss in young postmenopausal women results in fewer fractures in later life is lacking. A modeling exercise sug- gested that infrequent infusions of zoledronate at menopause would substantially reduce fracture risk and the number of women aged older than 65 years who had osteoporosis.111 Support for the concept of osteoporosis prevention by anti- remodeling agents also is found in the treatment of women with AIs for nonmetastatic breast cancer who experience bone loss and increased fracture risk.112 In these patients, bisphosphonates and denosumab prevented bone loss, and denosumab reduced the incidence of vertebral fractures by 50% within the first year of treatment, including in women with normal BMD values at baseline.113-115 Hormone therapy Several oral and transdermal systemic estrogen products are government approved in the United States and Canada for prevention of",

Although no clear differences in the BMD responses among different estrogen preparations or between oral and transdermal admin- istration have been observed, transdermal estrogen appears to have less risk of venous thrombotic events and possibly stroke. Bone mineral density The beneficial effects of systemic standard doses of oral or transdermal HT on BMD, including estrogen plus progesto- gen therapy (EPT) for women with a uterus or estrogen-alone therapy (ET) for women without a uterus, have been shown in NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 982 Menopause, Vol. 28, No. 9, 2021 \u0002 2021 The North American Menopause Society RCTs in both younger and older postmenopausal women.116- 120 In the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions trial (N ¼ 875), 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens (CE), with or without a progestogen (either medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA] or micronized progesterone [MP]), for 3 years signifi- cantly increased LS BMD by 3.5% to 5.0%, with a 1.7% increase in hip bone density.116 In the WHI, a 5-year RCT in postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years (N ¼ 16,608), standard daily EPT doses (0.625 mg CE plus 2.5 mg MPA) significantly increased LS and TH bone density by 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively, relative to placebo.121 Oral 17-b estradiol in daily doses of 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, and 1.0 mg increased LS BMD after 2 years by 0.4%, 2.3%, and 2.7%, respectively.122 Combining those doses of estradiol with norethindrone ace- tate 0.5 mg daily resulted in larger increases in BMD.",

In a meta-analysis of 57 RCTs in postmenopausal women, consis- tent BMD increases with ET or EPT were observed at all skeletal sites versus placebo.123 In trials of 2 years’ duration, the mean difference in BMD after EPT was 6.8% at the LS and 4.1% at the FN. Similarly, daily doses of 0.05 mg and 0.1 mg of estradiol acetate delivered via a vaginal ring significantly increased hip BMD (1.7% and 1.8%, respectively) and LS BMD (2.7% and 3.3%, respectively) compared with base- line.124 Lower-than-standard doses of ET and EPT are asso- ciated with significant, albeit smaller, improvements in BMD, although the number of women experiencing bone loss on lower doses is likely higher.118,120,122,125-127 Fracture risk In the WHI, ET with CE alone and EPT reduced the combined risk of vertebral fractures, hip fractures, and total fractures by 34% compared with placebo in a low-risk fracture population.121,128 Hip fracture risk was reduced by 30% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.7; unadjusted 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-1.0), vertebral fractures by 30% (HR, 0.7; unadjusted 95% CI, 0.4-1.0), and other osteoporotic fractures by 20% (HR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9). Meta-analysis and a systematic review, dominated by WHI results, demonstrated that 5 to 7 years of HT significantly reduced risk of spine, hip, and nonvertebral fractures.129,130 Because no study, including the WHI, has evaluated the effects of estrogen on fracture risk in women with osteoporosis, estrogen is not approved as a treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Safety In the WHI, initial reports of systemic EPT showed sta- tistically significant increased risks of breast cancer, stroke, and thromboembolic events.131-133 In women with prior hysterectomy, CE alone for 6.8 years resulted in a statistically significant increased risk of stroke and deep venous throm- bosis, whereas breast cancer, coronary heart disease, total venous thromboembolism (VTE), and pulmonary embolism were not statistically increased.134 In the WHI Memory Study, a statistically significant increase in probable dementia was noted in women aged 65 to 79 years who received EPT for a mean of 4.0 years.135 After a mean follow-up of 5.2 years, there was a nonsignificant trend for increased probable dementia in women allocated to ET.

Discontinuing hormone therapy The beneficial effects of estrogen on the skeleton begin to abate within a few months of stopping therapy.

Extended use of HT is an option for well- counseled women who have low bone mass, regardless of menopause symptoms, for prevention of further bone loss and/or reduction of fracture risk when alternate therapies are not appropriate or when the benefits of extended use are expected to exceed the risks.142,144,145 Despite positive effects on bone, initiating HT in women aged older than 60 years or more than 10 years beyond menopause is generally not recommended because of con- cerns about cardiovascular safety.142,146 Although the optimal time to initiate ET or EPT and the optimal duration of therapy have not been established, ET or EPT should largely be used in the early years after meno- pause. Women with primary ovarian insufficiency, premature menopause, or early surgical menopause experience long- term AEs on bone, cognition, mood, cardiovascular health, sexual health, and mortality.147 For these women, an estrogen preparation should be considered, unless there are contra- indications, to prevent bone loss as well treat menopause symptoms, at least until the average age of natural meno- pause.142 Higher doses of HT may be needed to provide protection against bone loss in younger women, particularly those aged younger than",

Raloxifene is the only EAA approved for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. In a 2-year RCT of 601 postmenopausal women without osteoporosis (mean age, 55 y), raloxifene 60 mg per day improved BMD by 1.6% at the LS and 1.2% at the FN compared with placebo (decreases of 0.8% and 1.2%, respec- tively).148 Bone loss resumes when raloxifene therapy is stopped.149 Raloxifene is associated with bone loss when given to premenopausal women.150 Adverse events with raloxifene include increased hot flashes, leg cramps, and an increased risk of VTE.151,152 In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, raloxifene signif- icantly reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 76% after 3 years and by 59% after 8 years of therapy.153,154 Bazedoxifene with conjugated estrogens Bazedoxifene is an EAA that has effects similar to raloxi- fene on bone density and fracture risk in women with osteo- porosis.155 It is not approved as monotherapy in the United States or Canada. A daily fixed-dose combination of BZA 20 mg with CE 0.45 mg improved VMS, decreased bone turnover markers, and prevented bone loss over 2 years in young postmeno- pausal women.156-158 In a pooled analysis from phase 3 trials in young postmenopausal women with normal or low BMD, bone density changes versus placebo with BZA plus CE were 2.3% and 1.4% at the LS and TH, respectively.159 Because BZA is a uterus antagonist, and the rates of endometrial hyperplasia were less than 1% and comp",
    "[INTRODUCTION] pooled analysis from phase 3 trials in young postmenopausal women with normal or low BMD, bone density changes versus placebo with BZA plus CE were 2.3% and 1.4% at the LS and TH, respectively.159 Because BZA is a uterus antagonist, and the rates of endometrial hyperplasia were less than 1% and comparable to placebo, progestogens do not need to be taken with this combination therapy, based on safety data up to 2 years.158,160 In RCTs of up to 2 years with the combination of CE and BZA, mammographic breast density and rates of breast tenderness, breast cancer, vaginal bleeding, cardiovascular events, and VTE were similar to placebo.157 This combination has been approved in the United States, Canada, and Mexico for the management of moderate to severe VMS and in the United States and Mexico for prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. This product contains a warning similar to other estrogen-containing products. The best candidates for BZA with CE are postmenopausal women with a uterus who need relief from hot flashes and prevention of bone loss. Caution should be exercised in beginning any HT in women aged older than 60 years. Tibolone Tibolone, a synthetic hormone derived from the Mexican yam, has metabolites with estrogenic, androgenic, and pro- gestogenic effects.161 In young postmenopausal women, tibo- lone prevented hot flashes, bone loss, and vaginal atrophy.162 In women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, tibolone 1.25 mg daily significantly reduced the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fracture but increased stroke risk.163 It has not been approved in the United States or Canada but is used in Mexico for osteoporosis prevention.

Bone remodeling decreases, and BMD increases.164 There are bisphosphonates approved for both the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. In young postmenopausal women, bisphosphonates increase BMD over 24 months by 3.1% to 6.0% in the LS and by 1.8% to 4.0% in the proximal femur.165-168 Doses of zoledronate and alendronate approved for prevention are 50% smaller than the doses approved for osteoporosis treatment. Bone mineral density decreases slowly on stopping alendro- nate or zoledronate.103,169 Bisphosphonates can be considered to prevent bone loss in early menopause if estrogen cannot be taken or when ET or raloxifene therapy is discontinued.

PHARMACOTHERAPY TO TREAT OSTEOPOROSIS IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN The primary objective of treating women with osteoporosis is to reduce the risk of fracture. All drugs approved for osteoporosis treatment have been shown in RCTs to reduce fracture risk ( These drugs vary considerably in their mechanisms of action and their effectiveness. Details and nuances of their use are found in cited reviews. Combining therapies is not generally recommended to treat osteoporosis, although sequential therapies may play a role in preventing loss after certain therapies. Antiremodeling drugs Antiremodeling agents inhibit bone resorption by osteo- clasts, and secondarily, bone formation. Treatment results in the filling in of remodeling spaces in bone that are present at the beginning of therapy and in opening of fewer new remodeling spaces, resulting in increased BMD and skeletal strength and decreased fracture risk. These drugs do not repair deficits in trabecular architecture. Denosumab, the most potent inhibitor of bone remodeling, does reduce porosity in cortical bone. Protection from fractures occurs within 1 year of beginning therapy, persists as long as treatment is given, and wanes when treatment is stopped. Hypocalcemia has been reported with some of these agents. Low serum calcium should be corrected before beginning therapy.",

Therapy considerations. Raloxifene is an option for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women with a low risk of hip fracture, an elevated risk of breast cancer, and low risk of stroke and VTE. Bisphosphonates In RCTs, daily oral therapy with alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate and annual intravenous dosing with zoledr- onate reduced the risk of vertebral fractures by 41% to 70% over 3 years in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.191 Alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronate also reduced the risk of hip and nonvertebral fractures by 28% to 50% and 20% to 38%, respectively, in long-term extension studies.",

Bone mineral density in the TH and FN plateaus after about 5 years, with no further increases over the next 4 to 5 years.192,193 Registration for government approval of the commonly used weekly and monthly dosing regimens of the oral agents was based on studies comparing BMD responses to daily therapy rather than on fracture endpoint studies ( Adverse events include diffuse bone and muscle pain of unknown mechanism, worsening upper gastrointestinal symp- toms with oral bisphosphonates, and flu-like symptoms in about one-third of patients with the first infusion of zoledr- onate. Renal failure has occurred with zoledronate in patients with compromised renal function. Oral bisphosphonates are to be used with caution, and zoledronate is contraindicated in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Osteonecro- sis of the jaw (ONJ) occurs infrequently (1 in 10,000-100,000 patient-years) with osteoporosis doses of bisphosphonates.194 Invasive dental procedures and poor oral hygiene are risk factors for ONJ. Discontinuing therapy before an invasive dental procedure does not reduce the risk of ONJ,195 but improving oral hygiene preoperatively and using topical antimicrobial therapy with dental extraction does appear to reduce risk.196,197 A duration-dependent risk of subtrochanteric or femoral shaft fractures with atypical radiologic features becomes evident after 2 to 3 years of therapy, with an incidence of about 1 in 1,000 patients after 8 to 10 years of therapy.198 The risk of these fractures appears to be greater in Asian women, in younger postmenopausal women with low BMD rather than osteoporosis, and in patients with some genetic skeletal disorders such as hypophospha",

Patients on bisphosphonates for more than 3 years should be cautioned to report new thigh or groin pain so that radiographic evaluation can be undertaken. The risk of atypical fracture may decrease on discontinuation of oral bisphosphonates.200 Duration of therapy and bisphosphonate drug holiday. The effects of bisphosphonate therapy on bone remodeling and protection from fracture wane slowly (over 1-5 y) when treatment is stopped.192,193,201 Because of this unique phar- macology, a temporary withdrawal of therapy (‘‘bisphospho- nate holiday’’) can be considered after 3 to 5 years of therapy in patients at low or moderate fracture risk and who no longer meet criteria for therapy.5,7,130,202 Fracture risk increases again when patients have been off oral bisphosphonate ther- apy for 2 years.203 Osteoporosis treatment should be restarted with a significant decline in BMD, an intervening fracture, or other factors altering clinical risk.5,191,202 For patients remain- ing at high risk after 3 to 5 years of bisphosphonate therapy (history of previous spine or hip fracture or multiple other fractures, hip BMD values remaining in the osteoporosis range, or who have other important risk factors), continuing on the bisphosphonate or switching to denosumab or an osteoanabolic agent is recommended.5,7,202 Therapy considerations.

Con- sider a bisphosphonate holiday only in women at low or moderate fracture risk. Denosumab This fully human monoclonal antibody inhibits RANK ligand, the principal stimulator of bone resorption. Treatment with denosumab 60 mg by subcutaneous injection every 6 months results in marked inhibition of bone remodeling, with resorption inhibited more than formation.204 In a pivotal RCT, denosumab therapy for 3 years reduced the risk of vertebral fractures by 68% and hip fractures by 40% in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.178 Over 10 years, BMD increased by 21.7% and 9.2% in the LS and TH, respectively, and protection from fracture persisted or improved. In that trial, skin rash and skin infection occurred more frequently with denosumab than placebo but did not increase in frequency with long-term therapy. Denosumab can be used in patients with impaired renal function, but hypocalcemia is more common. Rare cases of atypical femoral fractures and ONJ were observed with long-term therapy. The relationship between duration of denosumab therapy and these possible AEs is unclear. No other AEs were observed over 10 years of treatment.192 Discontinuing denosumab.

Bone mineral density NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 986 Menopause, Vol. 28, No. 9, 2021 \u0002 2021 The North American Menopause Society decreases rapidly, and vertebral fracture protection is lost. Vertebral fractures, often multiple, occurring 3 to 18 months after stopping denosumab treatment have been reported.205 There is no justification for a ‘‘holiday’’ with denosumab therapy. Whenever denosumab is stopped, therapy with a bisphosphonate should be used to prevent bone loss.206,207 Therapy considerations. Denosumab is appropriate for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, including those at high risk of fractures. There is no limit to the duration of denosumab therapy. Administration of denosumab should not be delayed or stopped beyond 7 months without subsequent therapy to prevent bone loss and vertebral fractures. Calcitonin-salmon Nasal spray calcitonin-salmon is recommended for the treatment of osteoporosis only for women who cannot tolerate other therapies.5 Calcitonin-salmon may reduce pain and shorten time to mobilization after an acute vertebral frac- ture.208 Osteoanabolic therapies These bone-building drugs stimulate bone formation and restore the structure of trabecular bone by increasing the number and width of trabeculae and improving cortical thickness.209 The bone-forming effects of these agents dimin- ish over several months (antisclerostin therapy) to a few years (PTH-receptor agonists). For these and other reasons, therapy with anabolic agents is limited to treatment intervals of 12 to 24 months. Bone mineral density is lost rapidly when osteoa- nabolic agents are discontinued.

    "[INTRODUCTION] For these and other reasons, therapy with anabolic agents is limited to treatment intervals of 12 to 24 months. Bone mineral density is lost rapidly when osteoa- nabolic agents are discontinued. To maintain the treatment benefits, these therapies should always be followed by an antiremodeling drug. Osteoanabolic therapies are more effec- tive than antiremodeling agents at increasing BMD and reducing fractures and should be the initial therapy for osteoporosis in women at very high or imminent risk of fracture.6,7,51 Parathyroid hormone receptor agonists Teriparatide and abaloparatide activate the PTH receptor, stimulating bone formation on trabecular and endocortical bone surfaces, leading to increased skeletal mass and volume, improved trabecular microarchitecture, increased cortical width, and increased bone strength.210,211 Both drugs, admin- istered by daily subcutaneous injection, significantly reduce risks of vertebral and nonvertebral fracture. Hip fracture efficacy was not demonstrated in individual randomized trials (limited by sample size), but a meta-analysis showed hip fracture efficacy with teriparatide.212 Orthostatic hypotension with first doses and hypercalcemia are possible AEs. High doses of both drugs induced bone tumors in rats, but this risk has not been observed in clinical studies. Neither drug should be used in patients with hypercalcemia, at risk for osteosar- coma, or with skeletal metastases. Previously, treatment with both agents was limited to 2 years in one’s lifetime. The teriparatide label changed (November 2020) to allow a repeat teriparatide course in appropriate patients. Abaloparatide is not yet available in Canada. Teriparatide. Teriparatide is a synthetic peptide comprised of the first 34 amino acids of PTH.210 In a phase 3 pivotal trial, teriparatide therapy for 18 to 19 months resulted in increases of LS bone density by 9.5% and TH bone density by 2.6%.179 The risks of vertebral and nonvertebral fracture were reduced by 65% an",

In women with postmenopausal osteopo- rosis at high fracture risk, teriparatide reduced risks of verte- bral fracture by 56% and clinical fractures by 52% compared with risedronate.213 Abaloparatide. Abaloparatide is a synthetic analog of PTH-related peptide analog, modified to potentiate its anabolic effect.211 In a pivotal fracture trial, women with postmenopausal osteopo- rosis were randomized to blinded abaloparatide 80 mg, pla- cebo, or open label teriparatide for 18 months.214 Bone mineral density increased with abaloparatide by 11.2% in the LS and by 4.2% after 18 months in TH BMD. Over 18 months, risks of vertebral fracture and nonvertebral frac- ture were reduced by 86% and 43%, respectively. These fracture-prevention benefits achieved with abaloparatide were maintained for 2 additional years when women were switched to alendronate. Increases in BMD, especially at the hip, were greater with abaloparatide than with teriparatide, but there were no significant differences in fracture risk between the two therapies. Romosozumab Romosozumab is a humanized antisclerostin monoclonal antibody that stimulates bone formation while inhibiting bone resorption.215 It is administered monthly as two subcutaneous injections totaling 210 mg for 12 months.

In women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, average BMD increases with romosozumab at 1 year were 13.3% in the LS and 6.8% in the TH. With 12 months of romosozumab followed by 24 months of alendronate or denosumab, total increases in LS BMD were 14.9% and 18.1%, respectively, whereas increases in TH BMD were 7.0% with alendronate and 9.4% with denosu- mab.181,182 In a pivotal RCT in women with postmenopausal osteopo- rosis, romosozumab, compared with placebo, significantly reduced vertebral fracture risk by 73% and clinical fractures (>85% of which were nonvertebral) by 36% after 12 months of therapy.181 The 25% reduction in nonvertebral fracture risk was not statistically significant. In a second pivotal trial in women at high risk of fracture, romosozumab was compared with alendronate.182 At 12 months, vertebral fracture risk was reduced by 37% with romosozumab compared with alendronate. After that 12 months, all women received alendronate.

    "[INTRODUCTION] mild injection-site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions. Compared with alendronate, romosozumab was associated with a higher risk of major cardiovascular AEs (heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular death), but there was no difference in rates of these events with romosozumab versus placebo. The explanation for the disparity in the results of the two studies is unclear.216 Romosozumab is not recommended for women at high risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly those who have had recent heart attacks or strokes. Therapy considerations. Osteoanabolic therapy results in larger, faster gains in BMD and better protection from fractures than do bisphosph- onates. Anabolic therapy should be followed by a potent antiremodeling agent to maintain gains in BMD. Bone min- eral density gains, particularly in the hip, are greater when the anabolic drug is administered before the antiremodeling drug compared with the opposite sequence. The best candidates are women at very high risk of fracture, including those with prior and especially recent fractures, very low BMD (T-score below \u00033.0), and those who sustain fractures or lose BMD while taking antiremodeling therapy. DEVELOPING AN OSTEOPOROSIS TREATMENT PLAN Osteoporosis is a chronic, progressive, and currently incur- able disease requiring life-long management. There is no single treatment paradigm. Rather, treatment must be indi- vidualized and then monitored and altered depending on the course of the patient.

    "[INTRODUCTION] isk, and other considerations. Moreover, different medications may be chosen for the same patient at different stages of life. Optimal management will entail the use of osteoporosis therapies in various sequences to maximize benefits and minimize risks across the lifespan of a postmenopausal woman. Goal-directed therapy, or ‘‘treat-to-target,’’ is an emerging concept to aid in the selection of initial therapy or when and how to change therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis.217 The fundamental principle of this concept is that the goal of treatment is to reach an acceptable level of fracture risk or suitable surrogate. The initial treatment is selected according to the likelihood of that treatment achieving this goal. If the response to the initial treatment does not achieve this goal, a change in treatment is considered. The value of BMD as an appropriate target as a surrogate of fracture risk is supported by recent studies documenting that the level of BMD achieved on osteoporosis treatments corre- lates strongly with a person’s current risk of fracture; the higher the TH BMD is on treatment, the lower the fracture risk.218,219 Those studies suggested that optimal treatment benefit is achieved at TH T-score values between \u00032.0 and \u00031.5. These data are bolstered by robust evidence from meta- regressions of published clinical trials of many medications demonstrating a strong correlation between the magnitude of BMD increase with treatment and reduction of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fracture risk.220,221 These results suggest that, for patients with very low BMD or very high risk of fracture, beginning therapy with an osteoanabolic agent followed by an antiremodeling drug is most likely to achieve osteoporosis treatment goals.51,222 The studies documenting the superiority of osteoanabolic treat- ments over antiremodeling drugs for reducing fracture risk in patients at very high risk of fracture strongly support this recommendation.182,213 This approach is even",

    "[INTRODUCTION] restart therapy if bone loss or fractures occur. If raloxifene or denosumab therapy is stopped, switching to a bisphosphonate would be indicated to prevent the rapid decrease in BMD and loss of fracture protection. Osteoanabolic therapy should always be followed by a bisphosphonate or by denosumab. Monitoring osteoporosis therapy Bone mineral density testing should be repeated 1 to 2 years after beginning osteoporosis therapy (depending on the drug used), with careful attention to quality control of the repeat testing.4,7 For patients on bisphosphonates, repeating BMD testing again at 5 years is used to determine whether a ‘‘bisphosphonate holiday’’ would be considered.202 Although changes in bone turnover markers are used by some specialists to assess adherence and effectiveness of therapy, routine use of bone markers is not recommended. Follow-up contact by an office nurse may be the most effective means to enhance adherence to therapy.225 Key points \u0002 The choice of the initial treatment for osteoporosis is based on the patient’s current BMD and fracture risk. \u0002 Raloxifene is an option for the treatment of postmeno- pausal osteoporosis in women with a low risk of hip fracture, an elevated risk of breast cancer, and low risk of stroke and VTE. \u0002 Bisphosphonates are appropriate to reduce fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. – Use with caution in patients with significantly impaired renal function. – Consider a bisphosphonate holiday only in women at low fracture risk who no longer meet criteria for ther- apy. \u0002 Restart therapy if bone loss or fractures occur or when patient again meets criteria for treatment. – For patients remaining at high fracture risk after 3 to 5 years of bisphosphonate therapy, continue treatment or switch to another drug. \u0002 Denosumab is appropriate for women with postmeno- pausal osteoporosis, including those at high risk of fracture. – There is no limit to the duration of denosumab therapy.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] ts remaining at high fracture risk after 3 to 5 years of bisphosphonate therapy, continue treatment or switch to another drug. \u0002 Denosumab is appropriate for women with postmeno- pausal osteoporosis, including those at high risk of fracture. – There is no limit to the duration of denosumab therapy. – Administration of denosumab should not be delayed or stopped beyond 7 months without subsequent therapy to prevent bone loss and vertebral fractures. \u0002 Osteoanabolic therapies are most appropriately used in women at very high risk of fracture, including those with prior and especially recent fractures, very low BMD (T- score below \u00033.0), and those who sustain fractures or lose BMD while taking antiremodeling therapy. – Osteoanabolic therapies increase bone mass more rap- idly and reduce fracture risk more effectively than do bisphosphonates. – Anabolic therapy should be followed by an antiremod- eling agent to maintain bone density gains. – Bone mineral density gains, particularly in the hip, are greater when an anabolic drug is administered before an antiremodeling drug, compared with the opposite sequence. \u0002 Bone mineral density measured while on therapy correlates with current fracture risk. \u0002 If the response to the initial treatment does not achieve preventing bone loss or reducing the risk of fracture, a change in treatment should be considered. \u0002 If drug-related AEs occur, appropriate management strate- gies should be instituted. If AEs persist, switching to another agent may be required. \u0002 Identify barriers to nonadherence to therapy and encourage adherence to the treatment plan. Providing clear informa- tion to women regarding their risk for fracture and the purpose of osteoporosis therapy may be an optimal way to improve adherence. \u0002 Depending on the treatment, an appropriate interval for repeat BMD testing is 1 to 2 years after beginning treatment or when a change in therapy is considered.",

Interpretation of BMD changes requires careful attention to DXA quality control. \u0002 If progressive loss of BMD or fractures occurs while on therapy, evaluate for reasons for suboptimal response to therapy, including poor adherence and underlying medical conditions or medications. \u0002 Even when treatment increases T-score values above \u00032.5, the patient still has the diagnosis and risks of osteoporosis. \u0002 Referral to bone specialists is recommended for women with very low T-scores, inadequate treatment response, including progressive decline in BMD or fractures while on therapy, or additional factors (eg, renal failure, hyperpara- thyroidism) requiring special management. CONCLUSIONS \u0002 Osteoporosis is a chronic, progressive health issue affect- ing a large proportion of postmenopausal women. \u0002 Menopause practitioners should be familiar and comfort- able with approaches to the assessment and management of bone health in their patients. \u0002 Once diagnosed, patients with osteoporosis require lifelong management. \u0002 Management of bone health in postmenopausal women involves assessment of risk factors for low BMD and fracture, encouraging healthy lifestyle habits to reduce risk factors, and if indicated, pharmacologic therapy. \u0002 Effective tools for diagnosing osteoporosis and assessing fracture risk are available, and well-studied strategies exist for managing bone health in women at both low and high risk of fracture.",

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, followed by colorectal cancer in high-income countries and cervical cancer in low-income countries. Survival from cancer is improving and more women are experiencing long-term effects of cancer treatment, such as premature ovarian insufficiency or early menopause. Managing menopausal symptoms after cancer can be challenging, and more severe than at natural menopause. Menopausal symptoms can extend beyond hot flushes and night sweats (vasomotor symptoms). Treatment-induced symptoms might include sexual dysfunction and impairment of sleep, mood, and quality of life. In the long term, premature ovarian insufficiency might increase the risk of chronic conditions such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Diagnosing menopause after cancer can be challenging as menopausal symptoms can overlap with other common symptoms in patients with cancer, such as fatigue and sexual dysfunction. Menopausal hormone therapy is an effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and seems to be safe for many patients with cancer. When hormone therapy is contraindicated or avoided, emerging evidence supports the efficacy of non-pharmacological and non-hormonal treatments, although most evidence is based on women older than 50 years with breast cancer. Vaginal oestrogen seems safe for most patients with genitourinary symptoms, but there are few non-hormonal options. Many patients have inadequate centralised care for managing menopausal symptoms after cancer treatment, and more information is needed about cost-effective and patient-focused models of care for this growing population.",

Many patients have inadequate centralised care for managing menopausal symptoms after cancer treatment, and more information is needed about cost-effective and patient-focused models of care for this growing population. Introduction The average age at natural menopause is 51 years in high-income countries (HICs).1 A systematic review and meta-analysis in 2014 showed an earlier age at menopause in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) across Asia, India, Latin America, and the Middle East.2 Menopause is more likely to be premature (ie, occurring before age 40 years) or early (ie, at age 41–44 years) after cancer and burgeoning evidence indicates that young age at menopause can be a risk factor for chronic disease.3 A 2017 meta-analysis of 45 studies in female patients who had survived cancer found a median age at menopause of 44 years.4 Guidelines from the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) for younger postmenopausal women without contraindications,5 but often the safety and efficacy of MHT after cancer is uncertain. Crucially, most patients who have troublesome menopausal symptoms after cancer do not have access to effective treatments, even in HICs.6 This Series paper will address the prevention and management of menopausal symptoms after cancer, including evidence about health disparities if available.7 Menopause happens to all people with typically functioning ovaries who reach the relevant age.

We recognise that this population includes some transgender men and other gender-diverse people; therefore, in some instances, we have referred to “people” rather than “women” to be as accurate and inclusive as possible. However, since much published work refers to people experiencing menopause collectively as women and does not clarify how findings might apply to the specific needs of gender-diverse people, we have also used “women” in some instances, to avoid inappropriate generalisation. More information is needed about the experience of menopause in transgender men and gender-diverse people. Evidence on menopause in gender-diverse people is scarce and this area needs more attention.8 Search strategy and selection criteria The recommendations in this Series paper are based on a review of the published literature and appraisal of professional guidelines.

This treatment can lead to more severe vasomotor symptoms (ie, hot flushes and night sweats) compared with natural menopause, particularly in younger women.11,12 Patients with oestrogen-receptor-positive postmenopausal breast cancer are advised to take third-generation aromatase inhibitors (eg, anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane), which can induce or aggravate menopausal symptoms including hot flushes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness.13 Menopausal symptoms are a common reason for not starting or prematurely stopping endocrine therapy, which directly increases morbidity and mortality from breast cancer.11 Newer protocols extending endocrine therapy from 5 years to 10 years in oestrogen-receptor- positive or pro­gesterone-receptor-positive cancer are likely to increase the burden of symptoms. In a 2021 community-based survey (n=385), the prevalence of menopausal symptoms in survivors of breast cancer 6 years after diagnosis was high: 346 (90%) had vasomotor symptoms or sleep disturbance, 289 (75%) had vaginal dryness, 240 (62%) had mood swings, and 229 (59%) had sexual difficulties.6 Severity of hot flushes and sleep disturbance predicted their inability to resume everyday activities. Less than a third were offered treatment and less than half found this to be effective. These symptoms can cause distress and impair quality of life, and managing these symptoms is a leading priority for patients with cancer.14 Around a third of patients with breast cancer are dissatisfied with the information provided about the effects of cancer treatment on reproductive outcomes such as menopause.15 Around one in 400 women are at elevated risk of ovarian cancer due to pathogenic gene v",

In 2023, new international consensus guidelines provided recommendations for symptom management and prevention of chronic disease following risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy in premenopausal women with the BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant.21 Key messages • More than 9 million women are diagnosed with cancer each year and treatments commonly induce early menopause and menopausal symptoms • Many patients do not have access to effective treatments, even in high-income countries, with an even greater impairment of quality of life and psychological distress in low-income settings • Diagnosing menopause after cancer can be challenging and many women resume menstruation within 2 years of chemotherapy completion; undetectable anti-Müllerian hormone at 30 months predicts menopause after chemotherapy for breast cancer and menopause is almost universal after ovarian radiation • Women younger than 45 years without contraindications should be offered an individualised treatment plan including menopausal hormone therapy after cancer treatment • If menopausal hormone thera",

The primary care provider knows her well. The patient previously had imaging to investigate right-sided pain, which revealed a complex ovarian mass. This mass was subsequently found to be stage 1C1 high-grade serous ovarian cancer. She had a total abdominal hysterectomy and removal of both ovaries, staging laparotomy, and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. Genetic testing showed that she carried the BRCA1 pathogenic variant, so both ovaries were removed. She also decided to undergo risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy with informed consent. • When the primary care provider asked more about her sleeping problems, the patient started to cry. She was frustrated by this show of emotion and said that she was not herself anymore. She found that minor problems were harder to deal with and she easily became emotional, which had caused arguments with her partner and her parents. Her family members were concerned about her health during her cancer treatment, but now that she was cured, they did not understand why she was always angry or sad. When she tried to make up with her partner, he often wanted to initiate sex. However, sexual intercourse was painful. Also, she was self-conscious about her appearance after mastectomy.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] during her cancer treatment, but now that she was cured, they did not understand why she was always angry or sad. When she tried to make up with her partner, he often wanted to initiate sex. However, sexual intercourse was painful. Also, she was self-conscious about her appearance after mastectomy. • She was concerned about these changes and the effect they had on her life, especially at night. When she eventually fell asleep, she sometimes suddenly woke up feeling very hot, sweaty, and anxious. Sometimes these sensations also occurred during the day. After telling her story, she felt relieved to have told someone about her problems and was hopeful that the primary care provider could help to solve them. • The primary care provider discussed with the patient that her symptoms (mood changes, vaginal dryness, hot flushes, and sleep disturbance) are all common after surgical menopause. This information gave great relief to the patient, who did not realise that removing her ovaries might have this effect. Previously she was blaming herself for feeling angry or sad, felt guilty about being unwilling to have penetrative intercourse, and was concerned about her relationship. She was also fearful that night sweats were a sign of brain metastases from her ovarian cancer. The primary care provider gave her information about symptoms after surgical menopause and possible treatments and made another appointment. • When she returned a week later, the patient felt somewhat better. However, she continued to experience troublesome hot flushes, sleep disturbance, and vaginal dryness. The primary care provider had contacted the gynaecological oncologist to discuss treatment options.

They advised that there were no contraindications to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) in women with a history of high-grade serous ovarian cancer; however, the relevant studies had small sample sizes and short follow-up. Although the patient had a BRCA1 pathogenic variant, there were no substantial concerns about breast cancer because she had undergone bilateral mastectomy and would be receiving oestrogen-only MHT. • Together, the patient and the primary care provider discussed the treatment options. Initially, the patient was reluctant to consider pharmacological therapies because she had taken so much medication in the previous year. During an individualised discussion of the risks and benefits, the primary care provider explained that MHT was the most effective treatment for hot flushes and night sweats and would also prevent bone loss. The patient and the primary care provider made a joint decision that she should try MHT. • A month later, the patient reported that her vasomotor symptoms were greatly improved and her sleep was much better. Her relationship with her family had improved and she had returned to work. She had recommenced sexual activity but continued to experience vaginal dryness, so the primary care provider offered vaginal topical oestrogen. However, the patient continued to experience anxiety, particularly a fear of cancer recurrence. Together, they agreed that help from a psychologist was needed, and the patient was referred for cognitive behavioural therapy.

Series www.thelancet.com Vol 403 March 9, 2024 987 life and psychological distress after cancer treatment is more severe in survivors from LMICs compared with survivors in HICs. Longitudinal studies reported young age and late cancer stage at diagnosis, low education and health literacy, financial hardships, and inadequate availability of supportive care as the primary reasons for continued distress of the people who survived cancer in LMICs.29 Menopause-related symptoms and their consequences often receive little attention, as follow-up care is focused predominantly on surveillance for cancer recurrence. Minimising the health consequences of menopausal symptoms induced or exacerbated by cancer treatment and offering resource-appropriate solutions will substan­ tially improve the quality of life of thousands of women every year. Preservation of ovarian function before cancer treatment Cancer treatments, including oophorectomy, gonadotoxic chemotherapy, and pelvic radiation, can induce meno­pause. Recognising the potential short- term and long-term value of preserving ovarian function, the European Society of Medical Oncology has produced guidelines recommending strategies to preserve fertility and ovarian function after cancer (panel 2).30 Gonadotoxic chemo­therapy, particularly regimens containing alkylating agents, commonly damage ovarian function and can induce permanent menopause.31 The effect of new targeted therapies and immunotherapy on ovarian function is uncertain, but in mice, immunotherapy is gonadotoxic and reduces ovarian reserve.32 In 2018, a systematic review found that ovarian suppression with gonadotropin-hormone-releasing hormone analogues before chemo­therapy for breast cancer reduced chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure by around 50%.33 A randomised trial is underway to determine if gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists prov",

Pelvic radiation for locally advanced colorectal and cervical cancers will induce menopause in around 94·1% of premenopausal women.36 There are few effective options for preventing ovarian damage due to chemotherapy. Preclinical data suggest that modification of pathways to primordial follicle apoptosis can protect the ovaries during chemoradiation.37 However, this approach has not yet been trialled in women. Moving the ovaries outside the field of radiation (transposition) can be protective and should be discussed as part of shared decision making. A 2019 systematic review of ovarian transposition before external beam pelvic radiation (n=765) concluded that ovarian function could be preserved in 20–100% of cases,38 with efficacy primarily dependent on age. In a small series of 22 women with low rectal (n=20) or anal (n=2) cancer, transposition preserved ovarian function in 90% of participants younger than 40 years but only in 38% of those older than 40 years39 (panel 2).

    "[INTRODUCTION] naging menopause after cancer There are no consensus criteria for diagnosing menopause after cancer. General diagnostic criteria, such as more than 12 months of amenorrhoea and elevated follicle stimulating hormone, cannot reliably be used, as ovarian function can resume many years after treatment. Although circulating anti-Müllerian hormone can indicate reduced ovarian reserve after chemotherapy, it does not reliably predict fertility, duration of reproductive life-span, or ovarian function.40 A cross-sectional study of 1043 women aged 20–35 years found that 31·6% had amenorrhoea after cancer treatment, with risk factors including chemotherapy, older age at diagnosis, and never having been pregnant. Overall, 70% resumed menstruation, with almost all (90%) resuming menstruation within 2 years of treatment.41 Women younger than 45 years with prolonged amenorrhoea after gonadotoxic cancer treatment should be offered MHT, provided they do not have Panel 2: Circumstances in which ovarian function can be preserved in gynaecological cancer Consider ovarian preservation in premenopausal women with: • Cervical cancer—stage 1 or 2A human papillomavirus- associated adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma of the cervix undergoing radical hysterectomy • Endometrial cancer—stage 1 low grade (not associated with Lynch syndrome or TP53 mutated); future molecular subtyping of endometrial cancer might improve stratification of care • Ovarian cancer—stage 1 (A) low grade, contralateral ovary could be preserved after explaining the 6–13% risk of recurrence in the preserved ovary; germ cell tumours with early unilateral disease Consider elective transposition in women younger than 40 years with: • Cervical cancer—locally advanced, if primary chemoradiation is planned • Rectal cancer—requiring neo-adjuvant chemoradiation • Cancer requiring pelvic radiation (eg, anal, vulval, sarcoma) Consider intra-operative transposition in women with: • Cervical cancer—if radical hysterectomy is abandon",

Management should be tailored to the individual, taking into account the patient’s age, cancer type, time since diagnosis (competing risks change over time), quality of life (menopausal symptoms), comorbidities (eg, venous thromboembolism, polypharmacy, and the potential for drug interactions), risk factors for chronic disease (eg, osteoporosis and ischaemic heart disease), and views and preferences. Evidence of moderate-to-low quality from the general population suggests that transdermal MHT does not increase venous thromboembolism rates.42 Since patients with cancer are at elevated risk of venous thromboembolism, we recommend offering transdermal rather than oral MHT. Testing of ovarian function after 12 months can be considered, depending on the cancer treatment. For example, ovarian function is unlikely to resume after pelvic radiation without ovarian transposition but might resume after chemotherapy for breast cancer, particularly in young women. In patients aged 40–45 years with breast cancer and secondary amenorrhoea after chemotherapy, an undetectable anti-mullerian hormone at 30 months is a reliable predictor of permanent menopause.43 In addition to MHT, there is growing evidence supporting the efficacy of non-hormonal and non- pharmacological therapies for menopausal symptoms, which has substantially increased treatment options for the management of vasomotor symptoms and (to a lesser extent) genitourinary symptoms associa",

However, given concerns for an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence, especially in patients who might benefit from low circulating oestrogen concentrations, we generally recommend against MHT in survivors of breast cancer, particularly those with oestrogen-receptor-positive disease. However, exceptions can be made if quality of life is substantially affected or disease risks are low after careful discussion and shared decision making ( For patients with cancer and POI or early menopause who are eligible to take MHT, the optimal duration of use is uncertain but should be considered until the average age of menopause (≥45 years) depending on symptoms and other health indices such as bone density. safety of MHT after cancer. about MHT use in female-specific cancer, and Red indicates that MHT should be avoided; yellow indicates that MHT should be considered.",

Non-pharmacological therapies for vasomotor symptoms Non-pharmacological approaches can also reduce the effects of vasomotor symptoms after cancer. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has the strongest evidence base. After breast cancer, CBT is effective delivered to groups, individually, online, or by specialist nurses, with a sustained effect at 26 weeks versus usual care, and it improves sleep and depressive symptoms.70 CBT reduces interference and bother due to vasomotor symptoms, which is a priority area for patients.71 Two small RCTs of hypnosis in patients with breast cancer showed improvements in vasomotor symptoms, mood, and sleep.44 Stellate ganglion block involves injection of local anaesthetic into the neck for the management of conditions such as complex regional pain and peripheral vascular disease. One small, randomised sham-controlled trial (n=40) showed a reduction in moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms with stellate ganglion block.72,73 However, this procedure is invasive and costly, with small but serious health risks. Acupuncture is of uncertain benefit for vasomotor symptoms but can help with fatigue and joint pain after breast cancer.44 Small RCTs indicate that yoga, relaxation training, and mindfulness-based stress reduction reduce vasomotor symptoms, with benefits for sleep, depressive symptoms, and self-reported stress.44 Physical exercise, supplements, and homoeopathy are ineffective.44 Lifestyle changes, such as dressing in layers, can help and a cool pad pillow topper reduces vasomotor symptoms after breast cancer.74 Non-hormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms In patients in whom MHT is contraindicated or should be avoided after cancer (table), a burgeoning number of non- hormonal therapies are available.

However, unlike MHT these therapies will not improve genitourinary symptoms or prevent fracture. Some antidepressants reduce vasomotor symptoms by 40–60%.75 The anticonvulsants pregabalin and gabapentin have similar efficacy.75 The antihypertensive clonidine is less effective than venlafaxine.44 One small RCT showed that oxybutynin was effective for vasomotor symptoms after breast cancer.76 There are few head-to-head trials of non-hormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms, which makes knowing what works best difficult. Selecting non- hormonal treatments should follow a shared decision making approach. For example, gabapentin reduces vasomotor symptoms but can cause drowsiness and hence is often more suitable for night-time symptoms. The dose of escitalopram for vasomotor symptoms is equivalent to the antidepressant dose so can be considered for patients who also have depression. Existing medications will also guide choice. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors should not be used together. A suggested approach to starting non-hormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms is oxybutynin 2·5–5 mg twice a day, escitalopram 10–20 mg, or venlafaxine 37·5 mg increasing to 75 mg controlled release. Gabapentin (300–900 mg) reduces night sweats and causes drowsiness, which might improve sleep.44 A systematic review of the side-effects of these non-hormonal therapies in patients with breast cancer reported that 81% of patients experienced adverse effects, which were graded as mild in 67%.77 Higher doses of gabapentin and venlafaxine were most likely to induce side-effects.77 Antidepressants should be stopped gradually.",

Targeted therapy with the neurokinin B receptor antagonist fezolinetant is available in the USA and some European countries. Two large RCTs have compared the efficacy of fezolinetant versus placebo for vasomotor symptoms over 12 weeks, with a 40-week open label extension.78,79 With 45 mg per day (the dose now marketed), there was a statistically significant reduction in hot flush frequency and severity up to 1 year and serious adverse events were infrequent.

One RCT showed that intravaginal testosterone reduced pain and dryness and increased satisfaction in patients with breast cancer taking aromatase inhibitors.100 However, the safety of testosterone after breast cancer is uncertain. Psychosexual inter­ventions including CBT, education, and counselling might be helpful.101 An RCT showed that CBT improved overall sexual function and desire, arousal and vaginal lubrication, and sexual pleasure and reduced discomfort and distress after breast cancer.102 Brief sexual counselling by telephone or in person might also be effective.103 Management of genitourinary symptoms and sexual dysfunction after pelvic radiotherapy The vaginal effects of external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, particularly vaginal dryness, fibrosis, and shortening, which can present as pain with sexual activity and impaired sexual function, can be more severe than those of chemotherapy.101 Vaginal dilators are reco­ mmended to maintain vaginal capacity after pelvic radiation, but uptake is low at less than 25% of patients and the evidence base is scant.101 In 2014, a systematic review found no reliable evidence that routine regular vaginal dilation during radiotherapy prevents stenosis or improves quality of life.104 Vaginal oestrogen is commonly offered with little evidence to support efficacy.

Pelvic floor dysfunction, including urinary and faecal incontinence, dyspareunia, and vaginismus, are common after gynaecological cancer treatment. A small RCT (n=34) showed that pelvic floor physiotherapy improved sexual function after gynaecological cancer.105 Integrative oncology Integrative oncology describes the use of complementary treatments alongside conventional cancer therapies. This approach takes a patient-centred, evidence-informed perspective and uses mind–body practices, natural products, and lifestyle modifications alongside conventional treatments. Integrative oncology might include therapies such as CBT, mindfulness, and hypnosis for vasomotor symptoms, mood, and sleep.106 Patients with cancer in many settings rely on traditional, complementary, and integrative treatments that are culturally appropriate and more accessible than conventional therapies.107 Although there is very little evidence to support the use of traditional and complementary therapies in cancer treatment, several randomised controlled trials have shown benefits for reducing symptoms such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, and insomnia, which could improve quality of life.108 Multidisciplinary care Managing menopause after cancer requires a multidisciplinary clinical team and the use of an evidence base to inform practice, optimal models for service delivery, and investment in sectors such as primary care and allied health.

    "[INTRODUCTION] estment in sectors such as primary care and allied health. Tertiary-based care cannot meet the needs of the growing number of people who survive cancer. Since menopausal symptoms affect a wide range of these patients, siloed care within tumour streams could lead to duplication of precious services. In Australia, the multidisciplinary Menopausal Service after Cancer (MSAC) provided by gynaecologists, endocrinologists, and primary care and allied health providers manages vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms, sleep and mood disturbance, and sexual difficulties across cancer types and in one place.109 A 2021 study showed statistically significant improvements in the four most troublesome symptoms (ie, hot flushes, fatigue, sleep difficulties, and loss of interest in sex) in patients whose care was managed through MSAC.110 To minimise cost and reduce waste, clear guidelines are needed to support the management of menopausal symptoms after cancer. This approach should include high-quality information for patients about hormonal, non-hormonal, and psychological treatment options that stratify risk according to cancer type. Involving patients in decisions about their care and enabling them to make informed choices is key and is likely to lead to better outcomes. COVID-19 changed how medical care is delivered. Telemedicine can extend the reach of care and increase convenience for patients. In 2021, a systematic review reported that digital health interventions were helpful and effective for supportive care in patients with cancer. Most studies reported positive outcomes for symptoms such as fatigue and pain, health-related quality of life, functional capacity, and mood compared with usual care, although most studies were in breast cancer.111 Telehealth is also accessible and effective for managing menopausal symptoms after cancer and could reduce the burden of hospital appointments.",

Patients with cancer often prefer video telehealth when physical examination is not needed.112 Telehealth can also be delivered directly to the primary care provider who has reviewed and examined the patient, which can reduce the need for tertiary referral.113 Tertiary care should be multidisciplinary, inclusive of all symptomatic patients, and should aim to manage all Series 992 www.thelancet.com Vol 403 March 9, 2024 common symptoms.114 In-person visits are needed for vulval and vaginal examination to manage chronic genital graft versus host disease, which affects around 30% of allograft patients in whom effective management can prevent severe complications such as vaginal stenosis.115 In breast cancer, RCT evidence supports the role of nurse practitioners in patient counselling and education and to assess symptoms.116 Allied health professionals such as primary care providers are well placed to provide ongoing psychological support, monitor for short-term and long-term complications of cancer treatment, modify risk factors, and make timely onward referral as needed. Care delivered by allied health-care professionals and their peers in discussion with cancer specialists might be more sustainable than ongoing tertiary care. Health disparities in LMICs Rates of treatment-induced menopause are elevated in LMICs, where the average age at cancer diagnosis is 40–50 years compared with 66 years in HICs.24 In these settings, more women are diagnosed with cancer when they are still premenopausal and are exposed to treatments that are likely to induce POI or early menopause.

    "[INTRODUCTION] 40–50 years compared with 66 years in HICs.24 In these settings, more women are diagnosed with cancer when they are still premenopausal and are exposed to treatments that are likely to induce POI or early menopause. Prevention and management of treatment-induced menopause is an unmet need in LMICs. Supportive care should be integrated into the comprehensive cancer care model through the training of primary and tertiary health- care providers and the provision of essential and affordable medication to manage symptoms. Education for patients and their carers should include identification of symptoms, self-management approaches, and pathways for seeking care. Scarcity of evidence from high-quality research is commonly cited as the key reason for not integrating traditional and complementary medicine into cancer survivorship care.117 Evidence gaps Almost all published studies of menopause and cancer are in early breast cancer, and less is known about advanced breast cancer or other cancers in women. There are no reliable ways of predicting who will experience severe or prolonged menopausal symptoms following cancer treatment. In breast cancer, vaginal dryness is more common with aromatase inhibitors than tamoxifen, and some evidence suggests that switching between tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors can improve vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women.13,118 Among premenopausal women, switching to tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression or tamoxifen alone might improve vaginal dryness, and this treatment can be considered by the treating oncologist when weighing the advantages and disadvantages of disease risks and tolerance of therapy.119 Decisions regarding the necessity and type of hormonal therapy used for breast cancer treatment depend on menopausal status, evolving literature, disease risk, and patients’ comorbidities, tolerance over time, and preferences.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] vantages and disadvantages of disease risks and tolerance of therapy.119 Decisions regarding the necessity and type of hormonal therapy used for breast cancer treatment depend on menopausal status, evolving literature, disease risk, and patients’ comorbidities, tolerance over time, and preferences. Although aromatase inhibitors have become the standard of care for many patients with oestrogen- positive breast cancer (with ovarian suppression in premenopausal women), there are commonly issues with access and cost for women in LMICs. Tamoxifen is widely used for premenopausal and postmenopausal women in these settings, and it is included in WHO’s list of essential cancer medicines. More information is needed about the effect of long-term tamoxifen use on menopausal symptoms and quality of life for patients from LMICs, especially when they transition from premenopausal to postmenopausal. Most clinical trials of treatments for menopausal symptoms were done in older women but younger patients with cancer can experience severe symptoms and worse quality of life.120 Little is known about the effects of cancer treatment in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and intersex (LGBTQI+) individuals, but some people report hostility and prejudice from health-care providers and anxiety about disclosing their sexual orientation and gender identity.121 In Australia, these data have informed a new information resource for LGBTQI+ people with cancer. Although new non-hormonal and non-pharmacological treatments are needed for patients with contraindications to MHT, young patients with cancer who are eligible to take MHT might not be offered it. New MHT preparations are emerging, including selective oestrogen receptor modulators and non-hormonal therapies targeting the neurokinin B receptor.",

New MHT preparations are emerging, including selective oestrogen receptor modulators and non-hormonal therapies targeting the neurokinin B receptor. One targeted therapy (Q-122) has shown moderate efficacy for vasomotor symptoms in patients with breast cancer taking endocrine therapy.122 Fezolinetant is available in some countries for vasomotor symptoms, with efficacy, safety, and tolerability shown up to 1 year in the general population.78,123 However, efficacy and safety of this agent after cancer are not clear. Safe and effective non-hormonal treatments for managing genitourinary symptoms after cancer are needed. The efficacy of vaginal laser is uncertain. A 2021 randomised sham-controlled trial of vaginal laser for genitourinary symptoms in postmenopausal women, of whom around half had previous breast cancer, found no difference between the sham and laser groups.124 In 2023, a randomised trial of carbon dioxide laser on sexual function in survivors of breast cancer showed no benefit over sham laser.125 Reaching the population who need treatment is a global problem.

    "[INTRODUCTION] Perspectives www.thelancet.com Vol 403 March 9, 2024 893 Profile Martha Hickey: responding to the complexity of menopause Menopause is the focus of Martha Hickey’s clinical work and research. “Not just as a hormonal event, but the meaning for individuals and society and how this affects the experience”, says Hickey, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaeco­logy at the University of Melbourne and Consultant in Gynaecology and Head of Menopause Services at the Royal Women’s Hospital in Melbourne, VIC, Australia. She takes a feminist perspective on meno­pause, which includes normalising this life transition and chal­lenging the prevalent idea that it marks a period of physical and mental decline. “Menopause challenges us to consider the role and social value of older women and the narra­tive that women’s behaviour and physical and mental health is powerfully regulated by their hormones”, says Hickey, a Topic Expert for the UK updated NICE guidelines on menopause and lead author of the Lancet menopause Series. The approach of this Series is to “move beyond describing and treating symptoms to a broader model of empowering women to manage this life transition”, Hickey says. The Series aims to provide the best available evidence, including symptom management and optimisation of health into later life. Speaking about the Series paper on mental health, Hickey comments: “Although it’s widely believed that mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety increase over the menopause transition, we did not confirm this. Most women do not develop mental health problems at menopause, but a particular group are at risk. Knowing this can inform new approaches to prevention and support. This information may alleviate concerns of others to know that they are unlikely to develop mental health problems.” Hickey grew up in Bristol, UK, and completed a degree in psychology and a master’s in clinical psychology at the University of Manchester.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] m new approaches to prevention and support. This information may alleviate concerns of others to know that they are unlikely to develop mental health problems.” Hickey grew up in Bristol, UK, and completed a degree in psychology and a master’s in clinical psychology at the University of Manchester. After working as a clinical psycho­ logist she later qualified in medicine at the University of Bristol and specialised in obstetrics and gynaecology. Hickey trained at St Mary’s Hospital and Imperial College London in the UK and at a research appointment at the University of Sydney in Australia. Completing her UK specialist training in 2001, she relocated to Australia with her young family the next year, becoming Assistant Professor at the University of Western Australia (UWA) and Consultant in Obstetrics and Gynaecology at King Edward Memorial Hospital in Perth. She was appointed Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at UWA in 2006. Hickey took up her current roles at the Univer­ sity of Melbourne and Royal Women’s Hospital in 2010. Among Hickey’s proudest achievements is establishing, in 2003, the first multidisciplinary service for managing meno­ pause after cancer, which has been replicated elsewhere. For the research underpinning the service, she says “we consulted with cancer patients, GPs, surgeons, and oncologists to work out what was needed. We found that people wanted common symptoms such as hot flushes or night sweats, sexual difficulties, and sleep and mood problems managed in one place, clear communication between health-care providers about what treatments were safe and effective, and the option of drug-free treatments.” Her clinical practice includes patients with BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants who are considering risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) causing surgical menopause. Recognising a gap in clinical care, Hickey led a large prospective controlled study that generated patient resources and knowledge to inform practice.",

Recognising a gap in clinical care, Hickey led a large prospective controlled study that generated patient resources and knowledge to inform practice. In 2023, she led international clinical guidelines on care after RRSO. She is now leading the Australian sites for a surgical trial of salpingectomy versus RRSO in high-risk women. Her team also leads a Menopause Priority Setting Partnership with the non-profit James Lind Alliance to determine priority research areas for those with lived experience of menopause and their health-care providers. Jane Ussher, Professor of Women’s Health Psychology at Western Sydney University’s Translational Health Research Institute, describes Hickey as “tireless in her appetite for bettering the health of women” and credits Hickey’s “acknowledgement of the complexity of women’s experiences of menopause, which cannot be understood within an entirely medical lens”. Hickey recognises the benefits of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), but sees a need for “greater transparency around how these products are marketed, such as the wide­ spread use of terms such as ‘bioidentical’ or ‘body identical’, which imply that MHT is completely natural and safe”. She hopes the Lancet Series will encourage “more discussion about the diversity of menopause experiences, less shame, and greater clarity about the risks and benefits of MHT. Like other life transitions menopause often has positive and negative aspects. Whilst it is important to hear about difficulties, persistent messaging around loss of youth, cognitive function, and sexuality does not reflect the reality for many. Older women are not just oestrogen-starved young women.” To counter negative images of menopause and ageing in women, Hickey led the Flesh after Fifty art exhibition.",

Older women are not just oestrogen-starved young women.” To counter negative images of menopause and ageing in women, Hickey led the Flesh after Fifty art exhibition. She believes a “greater appreciation of the incredible contribution that older women make to our economy and communities” is needed. “Women over 50 are the fastest growing demo­ graphic group in many countries, making an essential contri­ bution to society, families, communities, the paid and unpaid workforce. We need to support and empower women as they age and should not portray menopause as a period of decline and decay. Many women have healthy, rich, and fulfilling lives after menopause.

Rationale and impact These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice. Psychological support for early menopause Recommendation 1.2.7 Why the committee made the recommendation In the committee's experience, some people can be distressed by going through menopause at an earlier age than expected and earlier than their peers. If someone is experiencing emotional distress to a level that raises concerns, the committee agreed that they may need to be referred to psychology services. How the recommendation might affect practice It is common practice to provide psychological support to this group of people. While a potential referral will have a resource impact, support from psychology services will lead to improvements in quality of life and reduce future contacts with health services. Return to recommendation Identifying perimenopause and menopause Recommendation 1.3.3 Why the committee made the recommendation Evidence is lacking on the average age of menopause in people from ethnic minority backgrounds. However, the committee was aware, from experience, that people from some ethnic minority groups, and people with some lifelong conditions (for example, Down's syndrome), experience menopause at a younger age. The committee agreed it was important to raise awareness of this so that healthcare professionals can more easily Menopause: identification and management (NG23) © NICE 2025.",

Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- conditions#notice-of-rights). identify symptoms of menopause in ethnic minority populations or in people with lifelong conditions. How the recommendation might affect practice The recommendation will raise awareness that people from some ethnic minority groups, and those with some lifelong conditions, experience menopause at a younger age. It is unclear whether this will change clinical practice, but it might lead to earlier identification of menopause and earlier management of menopause symptoms. Return to recommendation Discussing management options with people aged 40 or over Recommendations 1.4.1 to 1.4.4 Why the committee made the recommendations Based on experience, the committee agreed that these basic principles of care would allow people to make an informed choice about management options: • using an individualised approach with discussions about benefits and risks of any management option and • tailoring information to individual circumstances and potential risk factors. Hormone replacement therapy The committee noted there are different ways of prescribing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in terms of mode of administration, types of hormones, schedule, and individualised dose and duration. All these options influence benefits and risks so the best combination of them differs from one person to another and should be carefully chosen with, and for, each person. The committee agreed that clinicians should provide and discuss information about all this so that the person can take an active part in shared decision making.",

Menopause: identification and management (NG23) © NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- conditions#notice-of-rights). Baseline risks of specific health outcomes and the benefits and risks of HRT also depend on a person's age at the start of perimenopause, as well as their individual circumstances and risk factors. It is particularly important to take age into account, for example, when thinking about the: • risks of dementia or stroke with HRT and • use of HRT in people experiencing early menopause. The committee agreed it was essential to discuss duration of use when a person chooses to take HRT. It was decided that this was important because, even if the exact duration is unknown at the start, people would get an idea (from the clinician's knowledge about typical use) how long they may be taking HRT for and be made aware that this would be discussed again at reviews. The committee also agreed that it is impossible to recommend 1 specific duration of use because this would depend on several factors, including the reason for starting HRT and a person's medical history, age and symptoms. It was agreed that it was important to discuss continuation of HRT at every review because circumstances and preferences could change. The committee acknowledged that, in many people, menopause symptoms may return when HRT is stopped. They agreed this should also be discussed with the person in the context of duration of use. The person should also be aware that, if this happens, they could restart HRT, if this would still provide the best balance benefits and risks for them.",

The person should also be aware that, if this happens, they could restart HRT, if this would still provide the best balance benefits and risks for them. Cognitive behavioural therapy Evidence showed that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could be an option for some people with vasomotor symptoms, depressive symptoms or sleep problems. CBT could be used either alongside HRT or, for people for whom HRT is contraindicated or who prefer not to take it, instead of HRT. Several types of CBT (for example, online or group sessions) were found to be effective, but the evidence did not show that 1 option was better than another. The committee therefore recommended that the available options should be discussed with the person. They were also aware that some people needed information on what CBT involves. It was recognised that people have different preferences and needs and that these should be taken into account during these discussions (for example, reasonable adjustments may be needed for people with learning disabilities).

    "[TREATMENT] ndations Cognitive behavioural therapy for vasomotor symptoms Recommendation 1.5.2 Why the committee made the recommendation The committee based the recommendation on both the evidence and their expert knowledge. They looked at evidence on CBT compared with no intervention or to treatment as usual. There was no evidence available for trans men and non-binary people registered female at birth. However, the committee agreed that the use of CBT for menopause-associated symptoms would be suitable for anyone, regardless of whether they have taken gender- affirming hormone therapy in the past. (This is also covered in the rationale on managing symptoms associated with menopause in people who have taken gender-affirming hormone therapy in the past.) Overall, the evidence showed CBT was beneficial for women with vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. The benefits related to 3 outcomes: the frequency of symptoms, severity of symptoms and how much the symptoms bothered the person (using a questionnaire that measured 'distress or bother'). The greatest effect was seen in how much symptoms bothered the person – many women felt their symptoms affected them less after taking part in CBT. The committee also discussed the following limitations that affected the quality of the evidence: • some concerns related to study design and to potential bias in the way studies were carried out • uncertainties around outcomes, with different results being obtained for different Menopause: identification and management (NG23) © NICE 2025.

For this reason, the committee decided to recommend CBT in addition to HRT, or as an option for people who prefer not to take HRT or for whom HRT is contraindicated. They also agreed the chosen CBT approach should be specifically designed for menopause symptoms. How the recommendation might affect practice These recommendations are a change to clinical practice. While wider use of CBT as an additional option could increase costs and add pressure to already limited services, especially in the short-term, it also gives people more choices for managing symptoms, including the option to have both CBT and HRT. This may lead to better outcomes. The committee noted that there are long waiting times for CBT. They also noted that people currently trained in providing this kind of therapy may not be familiar with menopause-specific CBT, so training on this may incur costs and increase waiting times in the short term. However, online and group CBT may be easier and less costly to adapt to be menopause specific. There are also resources available to train people in providing menopause-specific CBT (that could also inform the adaptation of online CBT), which could facilitate implementation. Currently, the treatment recommended for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause is HRT. Access to CBT may address some health inequalities, providing other effective options for those who cannot or do not wish to use pharmacological treatments for menopause symptoms.

Why the committee made the recommendations The committee discussed evidence from network meta-analyses (NMA) which looked at a number of management options for specific subtypes of genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause such as vaginal dryness, pain with sex, and vulvovaginal discomfort or irritation. They also took into account evidence from the health economic model developed for the 2024 update of this guideline. There was no evidence available for trans men and non-binary people registered female at birth. The committee agreed that their conclusion from the available evidence could be extended to those who have never taken gender-affirming hormone therapy. But they did not think they could be extended to those who have taken this type of therapy in the past, because it is not known whether such therapy would alter the benefits and risks of any management option (especially hormonal treatments), or which management option might be best for the person. Evidence showed that vaginal oestrogen (particularly estriol but also oestradiol) was effective in reducing vaginal dryness and pain with sex. Estriol also showed effectiveness in reducing vulvovaginal discomfort or irritation. The economic model conducted for this review showed that vaginal oestrogen was cost-effective. There was limited evidence on long-term use of vaginal oestrogen preparations. However, the committee acknowledged that efficacy and tolerability would be assessed regularly, as per the recommendations on reviewing treatment. To gain a better understanding of it, the committee made a recommendation for research on the safety of vaginal oestrogen when used for more than 12 months.",

To gain a better understanding of it, the committee made a recommendation for research on the safety of vaginal oestrogen when used for more than 12 months. Based on their expertise, the committee agreed that what is known about the safety of long-term use should be taken into account and discussed with the person before offering vaginal oestrogen. They agreed that the following points should also be brought up: • Serious adverse effects from vaginal oestrogen are rare. For example, the committee was aware of the 2019 Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency drug safety update on HRT safety advice, which states that there is no evidence of an effect of vaginal oestrogen on breast cancer risk. This was consistent with the findings from the NMA, which showed that discontinuation due to adverse events was relatively low. Menopause: identification and management (NG23) © NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- conditions#notice-of-rights). • In the committee's experience, people are not always aware that symptoms often return when vaginal oestrogen is stopped. • Because absorption into the bloodstream is minimal, there is no need to combine vaginal oestrogens with systemic progestogen treatment to protect the person against endometrial hyperplasia and cancer (whereas, with systemic HRT, people with a uterus need progestogen treatment for protection – see the rationale section on starting and stopping HRT). Preparations were not all shown to be equally effective. However, there were also uncertainties around the differences observed. So, the committee agreed that, overall, it was unlikely that 1 type of vaginal oestrogen preparation would be more effective than another.",

So, the committee agreed that, overall, it was unlikely that 1 type of vaginal oestrogen preparation would be more effective than another. They concluded that people with genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause should be given different options for vaginal oestrogen preparations so they could choose the 1 they prefer. The committee thought that people did not always realise that moisturisers or lubricants can be used alone or in addition to vaginal oestrogen and, therefore, thought that this information should be included in discussions about management options. The NMA suggested that non-hormonal vaginal moisturisers and lubricants were less effective than vaginal oestrogen, but a smaller proportion of people stopped using their treatment when using non-hormonal vaginal moisturisers or lubricants than when using other types of treatments. This may suggest that, when non-hormonal vaginal moisturisers and lubricants worked for a person, the person felt comfortable to keep using them (for example, because these are readily available over the counter options). While the evidence highlighted uncertainty around the effectiveness of non-hormonal moisturisers and lubricants, based on their experience, the committee decided that moisturisers and lubricants could be tried when vaginal oestrogen is contraindicated or not preferred. The committee discussed the role of vaginal prasterone and oral ospemifene in the management of genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause. They noted that both these medicines are more expensive than vaginal oestrogen, moisturisers or lubricants. However, the NMA showed them to be effective in reducing vaginal dryness and pain with sex but not vulvovaginal discomfort or irritation. They were also seldom discontinued because of adverse events.",

Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- conditions#notice-of-rights). offered as a second-line management option when other options (vaginal oestrogen, or non-hormonal moisturisers or lubricants) are ineffective for persisting genitourinary symptoms or are not tolerated. Evidence showed that ospemifene was not cost-effective and could therefore not be recommended as a first-line treatment option for all people with genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause. However, the committee noted that, for some people, local application of vaginal oestrogen may be impractical. For example, people with physical or intellectual disabilities may find it difficult to use local vaginal oestrogen. Ospemifene is an oral tablet and should therefore be considered as an option in such specific circumstances. The committee was aware that the symptoms of overactive bladder can occur alongside genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause and that vaginal oestrogen can be given in these circumstances. They decided not to include people with a personal history of breast cancer in the recommendation on this because vaginal oestrogen is not the first- line treatment for genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause in this population.",

The committee also had methodological concerns about some of the studies, particularly about: • how they accounted for confounding factors (including how many factors, which factors and how they accounted for these factors in their analysis of data) and • duration of follow-up, which was not long enough to capture breast cancer recurrence. There was no evidence available for trans men and non-binary people registered female at birth.

But they did not think they could be extended to those who have taken this type of therapy in the past, because it is not known whether such therapy would alter the benefits and risks of any management option (especially hormonal treatments), or which management option might be best for the person. The committee discussed the evidence comparing vaginal oestrogen to no treatment in women with a personal history of breast cancer. Most of the evidence included all women together and so did not distinguish between those who used adjuvant treatment for breast cancer and those who did not. Based on this evidence, it is not possible to say with certainty whether vaginal oestrogen, when used for genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause, leads to any change in breast cancer recurrence or not. The uncertainties around the evidence also led the committee to agree that: • The first choice for people with a personal history of breast cancer and genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause should be non-hormonal moisturisers and lubricants. • Vaginal oestrogen should only be considered as a second-line option, when non- hormonal treatment has not been effective, and symptoms continue to impact negatively on the person's quality of life. The committee noted that people may not realise that non-hormonal moisturisers and lubricants could also be used in combination with vaginal oestrogen, so they agreed to highlight this. The committee made these recommendations because: • non-hormonal treatment may be less effective than local hormonal treatment but Menopause: identification and management (NG23) © NICE 2025.

The committee advised that the mechanism of action of aromatase inhibitors makes genitourinary symptoms likely. However, the mechanism of action of tamoxifen is less likely to cause genitourinary symptoms and may even alleviate some of them. Vaginal oestrogen may also lessen the efficacy of aromatase inhibitors. The committee agreed it could not be confident about the evidence on the safety of local vaginal oestrogens in those taking either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. This was because of: • concerns about the quality of the evidence and • lack of data comparing the risk of breast cancer recurrence in people taking aromatase inhibitors alone with the same risk in people taking vaginal oestrogen (the comparison was aromatase inhibitor versus aromatase inhibitor plus vaginal oestrogen). For this reason, the committee agreed that, if vaginal oestrogen is considered for people on aromatase inhibitors as an adjuvant treatment, treatment options should be discussed with a breast cancer specialist (for example, this may include switching to tamoxifen). The committee noted that treatment decisions would need to be tailored to each person because: • Some people have a lower risk of breast cancer recurrence than others (as covered by NICE's guideline on early and locally advanced breast cancer).",
    "[TREATMENT] for example, this may include switching to tamoxifen). The committee noted that treatment decisions would need to be tailored to each person because: • Some people have a lower risk of breast cancer recurrence than others (as covered by NICE's guideline on early and locally advanced breast cancer). The committee decided that this was an important factor because it is worse to potentially add to the risk of those who already have a high risk than those who have a low risk of recurrence. • Vaginal oestrogen is absorbed locally. Some of it is absorbed systemically, that is, further into the body, but, compared with systemic HRT, the amount is minimal, and so it may or may not be a sufficient amount to affect breast cancer recurrence. This makes it difficult to assess the safety of vaginal oestrogen with respect to breast cancer recurrence. In someone with an oestrogen receptor negative breast cancer, oestrogen does not affect the growth of cancer cells, but in someone with an oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer, it increases the risk of recurrence. Menopause: identification and management (NG23) © NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- conditions#notice-of-rights). In someone with an oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer taking adjuvant treatment: • if this treatment inhibits the production of oestrogen (in the ovaries or in fat or muscle tissues), it will have no effect on any oestrogen coming from a source outside the body, and this oestrogen would then be able to bind to cancer cells and stimulate their growth but • if this treatment stops oestrogen from binding to oestrogen receptors (regardless of whether the oestrogen is produced by the body or absorbed from some treatment), it will stop oestrogen, regardless of source, from binding to receptors on cancer cells and so their growth will not be stimulated.",
    "[TREATMENT] • if this treatment stops oestrogen from binding to oestrogen receptors (regardless of whether the oestrogen is produced by the body or absorbed from some treatment), it will stop oestrogen, regardless of source, from binding to receptors on cancer cells and so their growth will not be stimulated. There was relatively little evidence for the use of vaginal oestrogen to manage genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause after breast cancer, particularly related to long-term use and use in conjunction with adjuvant therapy. Therefore, the committee made a recommendation for research on the safety of vaginal oestrogen in terms of breast cancer recurrence. People who carry genetic variants that increase the risk of breast cancer No evidence on the use of vaginal oestrogen was identified for people who carry genetic variants that increase the risk of breast cancer. The committee therefore decided that it could not make a recommendation but made a recommendation for research on the safety of vaginal oestrogens for people who have a high genetic risk of breast cancer.

There was no evidence available for trans men and non-binary people registered female at birth. However, the committee agreed that the use of CBT for menopause symptoms would be suitable for anyone, regardless of whether they have taken gender-affirming hormone therapy in the past. (For more details, see the rationale on managing symptoms associated with menopause in people who have taken gender-affirming hormone therapy in the past.) Evidence showed CBT improved sleep quality, but this varied depending on the scale used to measure sleep disturbances.

The committee acknowledged there may be other options to manage difficulties with sleep associated with menopause. NICE will monitor evidence on these for a future update. While not all the CBT approaches used in the evidence were specifically developed for menopause-associated symptoms, the committee agreed that this kind of CBT would be more effective given that the evidence showed that: • the women with sleep problems also had vasomotor symptoms which can negatively impact sleep and • menopause-specific CBT was also beneficial for the management of vasomotor symptoms. The committee agreed that the evidence had some limitations, including uncertainties around: • outcomes, with different results being obtained for different outcome measurement scales and subgroups • how large the effect of CBT was, even when it was shown to be effective. The committee also had concerns around study design and biases around how studies were carried out. As a result, they recommended CBT as an option rather than as routine management for sleep problems associated with menopause. How the recommendation might affect practice These recommendations could lead to a change to clinical practice. Although increased use of CBT could have a resource impact and add pressure to already limited services, especially in the short term, it also provides more management choices, including the option to have both CBT and other treatments (including HRT). This may lead to better outcomes.

However, the use of online or group CBT may make it easier and less costly to adapt as menopause-specific CBT.

They agreed that this would facilitate implementation. Return to recommendation Taking medical history of coronary heart disease or stroke into account before offering treatment Recommendation 1.5.29 Why the committee made the recommendation For people with a history of coronary heart disease or stroke, the committee agreed that different risk factors mean that people have different baseline levels of risk. They concluded that decisions on HRT use for menopause-associated symptoms would need to be tailored to the person and their particular risk factors and risk levels and that, therefore, these decisions should be made with a healthcare professional with expertise in menopause. How the recommendation might affect practice It is current practice that people with pre-existing conditions get expert advice on HRT as a treatment option for menopause-associated symptoms. However, there is variation in which expert would be consulted on this. This recommendation will standardise practice.

Why the committee made the recommendations The committee noted a lack of evidence on HRT use in trans men and non-binary people registered female at birth who have taken gender-affirming hormone therapy in the past. This uncertainty means that, for example, it is not known whether past hormone treatment could influence the choice of HRT, or whether giving HRT to someone who previously had hormone therapy would alter their health risks. For this reason, the committee agreed that trans men and non-binary people registered female at birth who have taken gender- affirming hormone therapy in the past should be able to discuss their menopause- associated symptoms with a healthcare professional with expertise in menopause. They can then make a shared decision about any potential treatment the person may wish to have. Because of the lack of evidence, the committee also made a recommendation for research on the impact of HRT on health outcomes for trans men and non-binary people registered female at birth, which covers people who have never taken gender-affirming hormone therapy, or who have taken it in the past but are not currently taking it. The committee discussed the evidence related to CBT. This did not include evidence related to trans men or non-binary people registered female at birth.

Because, without further evidence, other recommendations in this guideline cannot be extended to these groups, the committee agreed that a separate recommendation would highlight CBT as a management option for these groups. How the recommendations might affect practice In the committee's experience, there is no clear current practice related to the treatment of menopause-associated symptoms in people who have taken gender-affirming hormone therapy in the past.

Return to recommendations Effect of HRT on life expectancy in people aged 45 and over Recommendation 1.6.1 Why the committee made the recommendation The committee discussed the evidence on the impact of HRT on all-cause mortality (life expectancy). The multitude of confounding factors that may affect life expectancy meant that evidence had to be restricted to randomised controlled trials (RCTs). This is because, in RCTs, participants are randomly assigned to different treatment groups, which helps control known and unknown confounders. The committee noted that high-quality evidence showed no difference in mortality with either oestrogen-only or combined HRT compared with not taking HRT. They agreed that this was an important finding and therefore emphasised the need to tell people thinking about either treatment option that taking combined or oestrogen-only HRT is unlikely to affect life expectancy. The committee looked at the analysis for groups of women starting HRT at different ages. They noted that, for most age groups, there was no difference in mortality between those who are taking or have taken HRT compared with placebo. There was also no significant variation in this difference depending on the age of starting HRT. A decrease in all-cause mortality was reported for 1 isolated subgroup (women starting oestrogen-only HRT aged between 50 and 59). In isolation, this was a statistically significant figure. But in a wider context, it cannot be interpreted as good evidence of a different effect in this group. This is because: Menopause: identification and management (NG23) © NICE 2025.

All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- conditions#notice-of-rights). • there was no identifiable pattern of change in risk as people aged and • the statistical analysis showed that any differences observed between age groups could be down to random chance and therefore did not represent a real difference between age groups. As a result, the committee did not refer to this decrease in all-cause mortality in the recommendation. How the recommendation might affect practice It is current practice to discuss benefits and risks with people when treatment options are being considered. The effect of treatment on life expectancy is an important part of these discussions and was not covered in the previous version of this guideline. The recommendations will standardise the information that will be given. But it is unclear how this will change the treatment choices made and how this will impact on practice. Return to recommendation Effect of combined HRT on specific health outcomes in people aged 45 or over Recommendation 1.6.2 and What this rationale covers The committee highlighted the importance of presenting people with a complete picture of benefits and risks associated with HRT to enable shared and informed decision making. This rationale briefly describes the available evidence on combined HRT and how it affects risks related to: • cancer: breast • cancer: endometrial • cancer: ovarian • coronary heart disease Menopause: identification and management (NG23) © NICE 2025.

It also covers other considerations related to cardiovascular disease, and the need for further research in this area. There was no evidence available for trans men and non-binary people registered female at birth. The committee agreed that their conclusion from the available evidence could be extended to those who have never taken gender-affirming hormone therapy. But they did not think it could be extended to those who have taken this type of therapy in the past, because it is not known whether such therapy would alter the benefits and risks of any treatment (especially hormonal treatments), or which treatment option might be best for the person. So, they made a recommendation for research on the impact of HRT on health outcomes for these groups. Combined and oestrogen-only HRT are prescribed to different groups of people, and so the committee looked separately at the benefits and risks associated with the 2 types of HRT. Why the committee made this recommendation Cancer: breast In line with other NICE guidance, the committee agreed that advice needs to be tailored to the person according to their individual risk factors, such as having a family history of breast cancer, living with overweight, or drinking alcohol. The committee acknowledged that people also need to be made aware that these factors will affect absolute risks of breast cancer both when not taking and when taking HRT.

The committee discussed evidence on the effect of taking HRT on breast cancer incidence and breast cancer-related mortality. For: • breast cancer incidence, the evidence came from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and a meta-analysis of individual patient data from observational studies • breast cancer-related mortality, the evidence came from one RCT and an observational study. Overall, it showed the risk of breast cancer incidence was consistently greater with combined HRT than with oestrogen-only HRT. The committee therefore looked in more Menopause: identification and management (NG23) © NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

RCT evidence Evidence from RCTs showed an increased risk of breast cancer incidence for women who are taking or have taken combined HRT compared with women taking placebo. The group included in the trial took combined HRT for approximately 6 years and was followed up for breast cancer for about 7 years after the trial ended. The evidence showed that, with combined HRT, breast cancer risk was increased regardless of ethnicity or whether there was a family history of breast cancer. Observational study evidence Evidence from observational studies was consistent with evidence from the RCTs but provided further information on the duration and recency of use. It showed that, for women who were taking combined HRT, the risk of breast cancer incidence: • was higher than in those who did not take HRT • started increasing in the first year of use • increased with duration of use.",

For women who had taken combined HRT in the past, it showed that the risk of breast cancer incidence: • remained higher than for women who did not take HRT • was greater the longer women had used combined HRT • reduced after stopping HRT but was still increased for as long as at least 10 years after stopping use. The evidence showed that breast cancer risk with sequential combined HRT is lower than with continuous combined HRT but is higher than without HRT.

All types of progestogen were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer incidence, although there was limited evidence on the risk of breast cancer incidence with micronised progesterone or dydrogesterone. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to say whether micronised progesterone or dydrogesterone may lead to a different risk of breast cancer incidence and therefore the committee made a recommendation for research on whether different types of progestogen in HRT alter breast cancer risk. It was unclear from the evidence whether, for people who take HRT, the risk of breast cancer changes with the mode of administration. The committee therefore made a recommendation for research on modes of administration for systemic HRT.",

Mortality related to breast cancer Both RCT and observational evidence showed that mortality from breast cancer was slightly higher in women who have taken combined HRT than in those who have not taken HRT. The committee agreed that a difference in breast cancer mortality would be consistent with an increase in breast cancer incidence and agreed that this should be explained to people. However, they also emphasised that the difference in risk: • is very small between those who have taken HRT and those who have not and • should be thought about within the wider context, in that there is no overall change in life expectancy with HRT. Return to recommendation Cancer: endometrial The committee discussed evidence from RCTs and observational studies. Some of the RCT evidence showed that using continuous combined HRT decreased the risk of endometrial cancer for women taking combined HRT, compared with women not taking HRT. For women currently taking continuous combined HRT, with any duration of use, some observational studies showed a reduced risk of endometrial cancer while others showed that there was no difference in risk of endometrial cancer compared with women not taking HRT.

The committee discussed the well-established association between oestrogen-only HRT and the risk of endometrial cancer. They agreed it was important to explain to people with a uterus that: • this is why they would be offered combined HRT as per recommendation 1.8.1 in the section on starting HRT but • although oestrogen has an adverse effect on the endometrium when used on its own, progestogens counteract this in a dose-dependent manner. They concluded that continuous combined HRT, where progestogen is taken every day with oestrogen, decreases the risk of endometrial cancer. Evidence from another observational study showed that sequential combined HRT, when used for 10 years or more, increases the risk of endometrial cancer, but not when it is used for less than 10 years. Based on their own knowledge and experience, the committee agreed that the risk is likely to increase slowly over time. They agreed that, with sequential combined HRT, the protective effect of progestogen increases with the number of days on which progestogen is taken every month. Because the way sequential HRT is taken may vary in duration of use, days of progestogen per cycle, and oestrogen dose, the committee decided to highlight how different sequential HRT regimens and duration of use affect the risk of endometrial cancer. However, they recognised that, overall, this corresponded to a very slight increase in the absolute risk of endometrial cancer.

Overall, evidence from an RCT suggests that the risk of ovarian cancer may increase in people taking combined HRT compared with people not taking HRT.

The observational evidence showed that the risk of ovarian cancer increased with HRT use. The committee noted that both the number of participants and the number of Menopause: identification and management (NG23) © NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- conditions#notice-of-rights). diagnosed cases of ovarian cancer were far larger in the observational evidence than in the RCT, which made the findings more robust. However, the committee agreed that, although the risk was increased overall, the risk was small in absolute terms, especially with the low baseline risk of ovarian cancer. Overall, there was an increase in ovarian cancer incidence by 1 in 1,000. The committee agreed that all of this should be explained when HRT is being considered. Return to recommendation Coronary heart disease The committee based their recommendations on evidence from RCTs and observational studies. The majority of the RCT and observational evidence both showed that the risk of coronary heart disease did not increase when taking HRT. The committee agreed this information should be shared with people to allow them to make an informed decision. The committee also discussed the evidence on the possible impact of 2 factors: • the length of time between menopause and first use of HRT • duration of HRT use.

This is because there were: • no statistically significant subgroup differences in the RCT evidence and • inconsistent results between different observational studies. Findings from the RCT evidence did not all lead to the same conclusions. For coronary heart disease and cardiac event composite scores, most RCT evidence showed no difference between combined HRT and placebo. This was shown for both continuous and sequential HRT.

Return to recommendation Stroke The committee based their recommendations on RCTs and observational studies. Evidence showed a significant difference in risk depending on the mode of administration. The use of combined HRT does not increase the risk of stroke when the oestrogen component is taken transdermally, but it does increase the risk if it is taken orally. These findings were supported by observational evidence. The committee decided that it was important to share this information so that it could be taken into consideration. However, national statistics show that the baseline risk for stroke in women aged under 60 is very low. The committee agreed that this should be explained to anyone thinking about HRT because the risk may remain small despite any change in risk reported in the RCT and observational study findings. RCT evidence The RCTs showed that, overall, there is an increased risk of stroke in women currently taking combined HRT with oral oestrogen. Menopause: identification and management (NG23) © NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- conditions#notice-of-rights). Evidence on duration of use showed that risk of stroke: • did not increase when combined HRT was used for up to 4 years but • increased when combined HRT was taken for 5 to 9 years. Evidence related to age at starting combined HRT containing oral oestrogen also showed a greater risk of stroke in women currently taking HRT. This risk increased with age at starting HRT (that is, the older people were when they started taking HRT). This was when HRT was taken for 5 to 9 years. Evidence also showed significant differences in the risk of stroke depending on ethnicity.",

Among those taking combined HRT, the risk of stroke was greater in women of Black ethnicity compared with people from other backgrounds, though numbers of people affected by stroke in all ethnic minority groups were small. Because of the small size of the population taking part in the trials, the evidence was not very robust, so the committee reflected this uncertainty by explaining that the risk 'may' be greater for Black people. The committee agreed that all of this should be explained to people from ethnic minority backgrounds to help them reach a decision. Observational evidence Observational evidence on oral oestrogen doses as part of combined HRT, when compared with not taking HRT, showed: • an increased risk of stroke in women taking continuous combined HRT when the oestrogen dose was high and • no difference in risk when the oestrogen dose was lower.

In what little data was available, the risk did not have a clear tendency to decrease or increase with either of the above 2 factors (that is, with the age of the person when they start HRT or the time between a person's menopause and when they start HRT). As a result, the committee decided to make a recommendation for research on the impact of timing of HRT on risk of coronary heart disease. Impact of the type of progestogen in combined HRT on cardiovascular disease risk There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether, as part of HRT, different progestogens had different impact on risk of cardiovascular disease. The committee made a key recommendation for research on different types of progestogen.

However, the committee did comment on whether the conclusions made in NICE's 2024 evidence review aligned with the findings of these 3 systematic reviews. Although there were differences observed in certain areas, none of them challenged the overall conclusion that HRT does not increase coronary heart disease risk.

To guide their discussions and support the recommendations, the committee agreed to focus on 2 observational studies, 1 from the UK and the other from Denmark (which both made the most appropriate adjustments for confounders). They also focused on the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) of women starting HRT over the age of 65, which is based on data from an RCT from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). The committee agreed that the evidence from the 2 observational studies was inconsistent: • One study showed no difference in risk of dementia between combined HRT use and no HRT, with different durations of use.

The committee agreed that, although both studies adjusted for many relevant confounders, neither adjusted for all. They concluded that the evidence might be at risk of bias from confounding. They noted that the evidence was for all types of dementia. The risk for some types of dementia may be different to others, and the proportion of each type identified at follow- up may differ for each study.

The committee were not unanimous in their interpretation of the evidence and how to formulate a recommendation best reflecting the evidence base. Some members of the committee had concerns about highlighting a risk of dementia when evidence from a UK setting showed no difference in risk. However, the committee reached a majority decision. Taking all evidence into account, they decided the evidence pointed towards a possible increased risk in dementia incidence if HRT is started at a later age. They agreed it was important that people thinking about HRT for menopause-associated symptoms should be made aware of this, so that they could make an informed decision. As part of this, the committee: • chose to use the word 'might' to express uncertainty, given the differences between study results • agreed that it was important to highlight, based on the WHIMS evidence, the increase in risk that was noted when HRT was started over 65 years of age.

Return to recommendation How the recommendation might affect practice It is current practice to discuss benefits and risks with people when thinking about treatment options. The recommendation will standardise and update the information that will be shared. While the 2024 version of this guideline includes some new or updated information to share, it is unclear how this will affect treatment choices and impact on practice. It is possible that the recommendation may increase the use of transdermal HRT, given that it was not associated with an increased risk of stroke (and, according to 2015 recommendations that were not reviewed in 2024, it is also associated with a lower risk of venous thromboembolism than oral preparations). Return to recommendation Effect of oestrogen-only HRT on specific health outcomes in people aged 45 or over Recommendation 1.6.3 and What this rationale covers The committee agreed that people should be presented with a complete picture of benefits and risks associated with HRT to enable shared, and informed, decision making.

It also covers other considerations related to cardiovascular disease, and the need for further research in this area. There was no evidence available for trans men and non-binary people registered female at birth. The committee agreed that their conclusion from the available evidence could be extended to those who have never taken gender-affirming hormone therapy. But they did not think it could be extended to those who have taken this type of therapy in the past, because it is not known whether such therapy would alter the benefits and risks of any management option (especially hormonal treatments), or which management option might be best for the person. So, they made a recommendation for research on the impact of HRT on health outcomes for these groups. Combined and oestrogen-only HRT are prescribed to different groups of people, as per recommendation 1.8.1, and so the committee looked separately at the benefits and risks associated with the 2 types of HRT. Why the committee made this recommendation Cancer: breast In line with other NICE guidance, the committee agreed that advice needs to be tailored to the person according to their individual risk factors, such as having a family history of breast cancer, living with overweight, or drinking alcohol. The committee acknowledged that people also need to be made aware that these factors will affect absolute risks of breast cancer both when not taking and when taking HRT.

The committee discussed evidence on the effect of taking HRT on breast cancer incidence and breast cancer-related mortality. For: • breast cancer incidence, the evidence came from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and a meta-analysis of individual patient data from observational studies • breast cancer-related mortality, the evidence came from one RCT and an observational study. Overall, it showed the risk of breast cancer incidence was consistently greater with combined HRT than with oestrogen-only HRT. Only women, trans men and non-binary people who have had a hysterectomy are eligible to take oestrogen-only HRT, so most people taking HRT will take combined HRT. The committee discussed the evidence from the analysis of different durations of use of oestrogen-only HRT versus no HRT or versus placebo. RCT evidence RCT evidence showed a reduced risk in the incidence of breast cancer for women who are taking, or have taken, oestrogen-only HRT compared with women taking placebo. Women taking oestrogen-only HRT as part of the trial took it for approximately 6 years and were followed up for breast cancer for 7 years after the trial ended. The evidence showed the risk was reduced regardless of ethnicity. There was insufficient data to detect whether having or not having a family history of breast cancer lead to a different level of breast cancer risk with oestrogen-only HRT. Observational study evidence Evidence from observational studies was not consistent with the RCT evidence but provided further information on the duration and recency of use. It showed that for women currently taking oestrogen-only HRT, the risk of breast cancer incidence: • was higher in those who had been taking HRT for at least 1 year and • increased with duration of use.",

Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- conditions#notice-of-rights). cancer incidence: • was not quite as high as in those currently taking it • was greater the longer they had taken HRT • remained higher than for women who had never taken HRT for up to at least 10 years after stopping use. Interpretation of the evidence on breast cancer incidence with oestrogen-only HRT The committee decided that the difference between RCT results and evidence from observational studies meant that it was not possible to be certain of the conclusions. They also agreed this should be highlighted in the wording of the recommendation, by explaining that there was little or no increase in the risk of breast cancer incidence. The committee also looked at evidence that compared different types of oestrogens and different modes of administration. The evidence did not show any differences in risk of incidence of breast cancer for different types of oestrogen. There was some uncertainty in relation to mode of administration. The committee therefore made a recommendation for research on mode of administration for systemic HRT. Mortality from breast cancer Evidence from an RCT showed that there was a reduction in the risk of mortality from breast cancer in those using oestrogen-only HRT compared with placebo. The observational data was not in line with the RCT data, as it showed there was an increased risk of mortality from breast cancer in oestrogen-only HRT users.",

The observational data was not in line with the RCT data, as it showed there was an increased risk of mortality from breast cancer in oestrogen-only HRT users. The committee agreed that, although the RCT evidence showed a reduced risk, there was also evidence showing an increased risk. Therefore, it was important to highlight in the recommendations that there is a possibility of a small increase in the risk of breast cancer mortality. Return to recommendation Cancer: endometrial The committee discussed the evidence from RCTs and observational studies. The evidence from RCTs was unclear because there were only 2 studies with no, or few, cases of endometrial cancer. Menopause: identification and management (NG23) © NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- conditions#notice-of-rights). The committee also discussed the evidence from observational studies on oestrogen-only HRT versus no HRT in women with a uterus. It showed that the risk of endometrial cancer is increased in those: • currently taking oestrogen-only HRT and • who have been taking HRT for over 10 years (and are still taking it) or have taken oestrogen-only HRT in the past for over 10 years. This increase in risk was present regardless of whether the treatment was oral or transdermal. The committee discussed the well-established association between oestrogen-only HRT and the risk of endometrial cancer. They agreed it was important to explain to people with a uterus that this is why they would be offered combined HRT as per recommendation 1.8.1 in the section on starting HRT. Return to recommendation Cancer: ovarian The committee discussed the evidence from observational studies. No evidence from RCTs was identified.",

Return to recommendation Cancer: ovarian The committee discussed the evidence from observational studies. No evidence from RCTs was identified. Overall, with oestrogen-only HRT, the evidence showed that the risk of ovarian cancer: • was higher in those who had been taking HRT for at least 5 years • increased with duration of HRT use. However, the committee agreed that risk remained small in absolute terms, because the baseline risk of ovarian cancer is low. The risk increased by 1 in 1,000 women for oestrogen-only HRT, when currently taking it, having started at the age of 50. The committee agreed that all of this should be explained when HRT is being considered.

All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- conditions#notice-of-rights). The majority of the RCT and observational evidence both showed the risk of coronary heart disease did not increase when taking HRT. The committee agreed this information should be shared with people to allow them to make an informed decision. The committee also discussed the evidence on the possible impact of 2 factors: • the length of time between menopause and the first use of HRT • the person's age at first HRT use. They looked at coronary heart disease risk for different subgroups, and at the statistical significance of any differences observed between these subgroups. As a result, they agreed they could not make any recommendations about the impact of either of these factors on coronary heart disease risk in people taking HRT.",

As a result, they agreed they could not make any recommendations about the impact of either of these factors on coronary heart disease risk in people taking HRT. This is because there were: • no statistically significant subgroup differences in the RCT evidence • inconsistent results between different observational studies and • inconsistency between the conclusions of the RCT evidence and observational studies. RCT evidence When looking at women of all ages at first HRT use together as 1 group, the evidence showed no difference in risk of coronary heart disease between women who had been taking oestrogen-only HRT for 5 to 9 years and were still taking it, and women who were not taking HRT and had never taken it. Subgroup analysis that looked at whether coronary heart disease risk was affected differently (if at all) for people of different ages at first HRT use, showed: • an isolated reduced risk in 1 subgroup (when people were 50 to 59 at first HRT use) but • no difference in risk for any of the other subgroups. In addition, statistical testing showed that the difference between people aged 50 to 59 at first HRT use and other subgroups was not significant and so should not be included in information shared with people considering HRT.

Observational study evidence The committee looked at observational evidence on whether the length of time between a person's menopause and the moment they start HRT affects their risk of coronary heart disease. For women currently taking oestrogen-only HRT, who had been taking it for an unknown duration, the 2 observational studies reported different conclusions on this: • One study showed a reduced risk of coronary heart disease when HRT was started within 4 years of menopause, while the other study showed no difference in risk when HRT was started between the ages of 45 to 54 (which is likely to be within 4 years of menopause). • One study showed no difference when HRT was started more than 10 years after menopause, while the other study showed a reduction in risk when HRT was started between the ages of 65 and 74 (which is likely to be 10 years or more after menopause). The committee recognised that some observational studies may have been influenced by residual confounding factors such as socioeconomic status, smoking, medical history or other factors which may be related to HRT use and cardiovascular risk. Differences in direction of effect across study types When looking at the effect of age at first use of HRT on the risk of coronary heart disease, there was also some variation in results across different study types, for example: • the RCT evidence showed no difference in risk when HRT was started between the ages of 60 and 69 • an observational study showed a reduction in risk when HRT was started between the ages of 65 and 74. The age groups overlap between the RCT and observational study, but the results for these overlapping age groups are contradictory, making it difficult to reach a conclusion with regards to age trends.",

The committee agreed that it was important for people to know this so they could make an informed choice. Return to recommendation Stroke The committee based their recommendations on RCTs and observational studies. The RCTs showed that, overall, there is an increased risk of stroke in women currently taking oral oestrogen-only HRT. These findings were supported by observational evidence. National statistics also show that the baseline risk for stroke in women aged under 60 is very low. The committee agreed that this should be explained to anyone thinking about HRT because the risk may remain small despite any change in risk reported in the RCT and observational study findings. Observational evidence showed that transdermal oestradiol did not increase the risk of stroke whereas oral oestradiol did. The committee noted that this was consistent with the pattern in combined HRT. They agreed that this should be explained so that people can factor this into their decision making. The observational evidence showed an increased risk of stroke when oestrogen-only HRT was given at a high dose while, at low and medium doses, there was no increase in risk for oestrogen-only HRT compared with no HRT.",

The observational evidence showed an increased risk of stroke when oestrogen-only HRT was given at a high dose while, at low and medium doses, there was no increase in risk for oestrogen-only HRT compared with no HRT. Risk was also increased in women currently taking oestrogen-only HRT who had been taking it for 5 to 9 years when they had been aged 60 years or over at first HRT use. The committee decided that both these points should be covered when making shared decisions on treatment. Return to recommendation Impact of timing of HRT for menopause symptoms on risk of coronary heart disease There was not a lot of data to check whether the following factors impact on risk of coronary heart disease: • the age of the person when they start HRT and Menopause: identification and management (NG23) © NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- conditions#notice-of-rights). • the time between a person's menopause and when they start HRT. This resulted in what is called 'lack of statistical power'. In other words, the small amount of data means that statistical test could show a difference where there is none. In what little data was available, the risk did not have a clear tendency to decrease or increase with either of the above 2 factors (that is, with the age of the person when they start HRT or the time between a person's menopause and when they start HRT). As a result, the committee decided to make a recommendation for research on the impact of timing of HRT on risk of coronary heart disease. Impact of mode of administration of oestrogen-only HRT on coronary heart disease There was no evidence on whether 1 mode of administration of oestrogen-only HRT differed to another in its impact on risk of coronary heart disease. The committee therefore prioritised a recommendation for research on the mode of administration for systemic HRT.",

The committee therefore prioritised a recommendation for research on the mode of administration for systemic HRT. Risk of cardiovascular disease with HRT in people from ethnic minority backgrounds The committee noted that there was little evidence for people from ethnic minority backgrounds for cardiovascular health and stroke (as well as all other health outcomes), so they made a recommendation for research on the impact of HRT on health outcomes for these groups of people. Other considerations relating to cardiovascular disease The committee were aware of systematic reviews by Boardman et al. (2015), Kim et al. (2020) and Salpeter et al. (2006) – see the list of excluded studies in evidence review C: cardiovascular disease and stroke. These 3 systematic reviews did not meet the inclusion criteria of NICE's 2024 evidence review because: • they combined data for participants who received combined HRT and oestrogen-only HRT (Boardman et al. 2015) or • some individual studies included within a review did not match NICE's 2024 criteria Menopause: identification and management (NG23) © NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- conditions#notice-of-rights). and therefore the entire systematic review could not be included (Kim et al. 2020 and Salpeter et al. 2006). The studies included in these systematic reviews were checked and any relevant ones were then included in NICE's 2024 evidence review if they matched its criteria. However, the committee did comment on whether the conclusions made in NICE's 2024 evidence review aligned with the findings of these 3 systematic reviews.",

However, the committee did comment on whether the conclusions made in NICE's 2024 evidence review aligned with the findings of these 3 systematic reviews. Although there were differences observed in certain areas, none of them challenged the overall conclusion that HRT does not increase coronary heart disease risk. Dementia The committee noted that there was relatively little evidence on dementia compared with other health outcomes, with only 7 studies identified. They acknowledged that most of the evidence was from observational studies and so they very carefully looked at how various confounders had been adjusted for. The committee agreed that some of the evidence did not make the necessary adjustments for confounding factors, such as socioeconomic status, or did not reliably ascertain incidence of dementia. To guide their discussions and support the recommendations, the committee agreed to focus on 2 observational studies, 1 from the UK and 1 from Denmark (which both made the most appropriate adjustments for confounders). They also focused on the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) of women starting HRT over the age of 65, which is based on data from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). The observational evidence showed no significant differences in dementia risk when comparing oestrogen-only HRT with no HRT use. The evidence from the WHIMS study also showed no significant differences in incidence of dementia, between those who are taking or have taken oestrogen-only HRT and those taking placebo. The committee discussed some of the limitations in the WHIMS study, such as the low incidence of dementia in the placebo arm, which was lower than the incidence of dementia in the UK.",

Recommendations for research The committee recognised that there are still uncertainties around the current evidence base and that further research is needed. They noted that the previous version of the guideline included a recommendation for research related to dementia and decided to keep this. The evidence was unclear about the impact of mode of administration on risk of dementia. The committee therefore prioritised a recommendation for research on mode of administration for systemic HRT. Return to recommendation How the recommendation might affect practice It is current practice to discuss benefits and risks with people when considering treatment options. The recommendation will standardise the information that will be shared. While the 2024 version of this guideline includes some new or updated information to share, it is unclear how this will change the treatment choices made and how this will impact on practice. It is possible that the recommendation may increase the use of transdermal HRT since it was not associated with an increased risk of stroke (and, according to 2015 recommendations that were not reviewed in 2024, it is also associated with a lower risk of venous thromboembolism than oral preparations).",

Return to recommendation Cardiovascular disease prevention Recommendation 1.6.4 Why the committee made the recommendation Given the findings about the effect of HRT on coronary heart disease and stroke (as covered in the rationales on the effect of combined and of oestrogen-only HRT) the committee agreed that the evidence did not support the use of combined or oestrogen- only HRT for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Return to recommendation Effects of HRT use in early menopause on specific health outcomes Recommendation 1.6.6 Why the committee made the recommendation No evidence was identified on the benefits and risks of either taking or not taking HRT relating to osteoporosis, risk of fractures or cardiovascular outcomes, or endometrial or ovarian cancer in people experiencing early menopause (people aged 40 to 44).

The committee did not look at evidence on whether early menopause itself may have an impact on health outcomes, and how to manage any impact it might have. Therefore, they could not make any recommendations on the benefits and risks of HRT to manage any differences in risk that may result from early menopause. The committee agreed it was important to take a person's age at the onset of menopause- associated symptoms into account during discussions about HRT (in line with the section on discussing management options). They agreed that the age cut-offs defining premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), early menopause and typical menopause were a little arbitrary. They also agreed it is clinically plausible that the benefits and risks evolve gradually from what they are for people with premature ovarian insufficiency to what they are for people aged 45 or over.",
    "[TREATMENT] mature ovarian insufficiency (POI), early menopause and typical menopause were a little arbitrary. They also agreed it is clinically plausible that the benefits and risks evolve gradually from what they are for people with premature ovarian insufficiency to what they are for people aged 45 or over. As a result, it is likely that, for people with early menopause, the benefits and risks of either taking or not taking HRT lie somewhere between those for people with premature ovarian insufficiency and those for people aged 45 or over, for whom there is more evidence about these benefits and risks. The committee discussed the similarities between early menopause and POI. Although there is little evidence of the impact of HRT on health outcomes in people with POI, it is current practice for this group to take HRT routinely. HRT is offered to them to lower the risk of some health outcomes, for example, osteoporosis. The situation may be similar for early menopause, for which routine HRT is also current practice. Evidence showed that, as for people aged 45 or over, the risk of breast cancer in early menopause is increased when taking HRT compared with not taking HRT. However, the committee agreed that taking HRT in early menopause may affect the risk of different health outcome in different ways (that is, it may decrease some risks and increase others), as it does for people with POI and for people experiencing menopause at 45 or over. As a result, the lack of evidence on outcomes other than breast cancer meant that it was not possible to make recommendations about the overall balance of benefits and risks of taking or not taking HRT in early menopause. The committee agreed that it was important to highlight this lack of evidence and made a key recommendation for research on the impact of HRT in early menopause on specific health outcomes to address it.

How the recommendation might affect practice While the recommendation may help people make decisions about treatment, it is unclear how it will change these decisions and how that will impact overall resource use. It would however be unethical to prevent such information being discussed with people experiencing early menopause even if it did lead to an increase in resource use. Return to recommendation Starting and stopping HRT for anyone Recommendations 1.8.1 to 1.8.3 and 1.8.7 Why the committee made the recommendations Starting HRT When a person decides they want to take HRT for menopause-associated symptoms, the committee recommended, that, if the person has a uterus, they should be offered combined oestrogen and progestogen. Whereas, if the person has had a total hysterectomy, they should be offered oestrogen alone. The main reason for this is the established knowledge that oestrogen alone, if given to people with an intact uterus, can stimulate the growth of the uterine lining (endometrium). In turn, this oestrogen stimulation can lead to an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia (overgrowth of the endometrium) and potentially, endometrial cancer. This is consistent with the evidence showing that oestrogen-only HRT increases the incidence of endometrial cancer in people with a uterus (see the section related to the effect of oestrogen-only HRT on endometrial cancer for people aged 45 and over).",

This is consistent with the evidence showing that oestrogen-only HRT increases the incidence of endometrial cancer in people with a uterus (see the section related to the effect of oestrogen-only HRT on endometrial cancer for people aged 45 and over). However, because it is now considered unsafe to give oestrogen-only HRT to people with a uterus, no further research is being carried out, and the recommendation is based on established knowledge more than on the evidence identified for this guideline. Adding progestogen to the HRT regimen helps protect the endometrium by counteracting the stimulating effects of oestrogen, and so reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Menopause: identification and management (NG23) © NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- conditions#notice-of-rights). Progestogen is given to protect the uterine lining, so it is not needed for people who have had a total hysterectomy. The committee discussed that this may be different for people with a subtotal hysterectomy. They decided that they could not be prescriptive about the type of HRT to be used for people who have had a subtotal hysterectomy because their condition is clinically complex, and they had not reviewed evidence about the effect of HRT on risk of endometrial cancer for this group. They acknowledged that people who were going to have, or had had, a subtotal hysterectomy would likely be under the care of a specialist (or a relevant member of the associated multidisciplinary team) who could discuss HRT options tailored to their needs. Some people have a hysterectomy for a condition that may be affected by HRT, such as endometriosis. The committee did not review evidence related to such conditions.",
    "[TREATMENT] f a specialist (or a relevant member of the associated multidisciplinary team) who could discuss HRT options tailored to their needs. Some people have a hysterectomy for a condition that may be affected by HRT, such as endometriosis. The committee did not review evidence related to such conditions. However, they recognised that the decision about the type of HRT that best balances benefits and risks for a person who has had a hysterectomy may be affected by the condition that led to the hysterectomy. For this reason, advice from a healthcare professional with specialist knowledge of that condition may be needed. The committee noted that it is common practice to prescribe the smallest effective dosage of a treatment to help balance its benefits and risks, so they recommended this for HRT too. Effectiveness of HRT can vary between people, so starting with the lowest effective dosage helps find the right balance between effectively treating symptoms and managing risks from the treatment, taking into account each person's specific needs. Stopping HRT A personal history of cancer is a contraindication to systemic HRT because it has been shown that systemic HRT can lead to cancer progression or recurrence. Therefore, the committee agreed that systemic HRT should be stopped in people who are diagnosed with breast cancer because this would be off-label use and therefore there would be safety concerns. However, they agreed that this is already covered in NICE's guideline on early and locally advanced breast cancer.

    "[TREATMENT] ext Since the previous version of this guideline was published, new evidence that could affect recommendations was identified through NICE's surveillance process. Full details are set out in the surveillance review decisions from 2019 and 2021. Menopause is the point at which menstrual cycles stop. Menopause usually happens in women, and in some non-binary and trans people, when they are aged 45 to 55, but can happen earlier, for example, because of surgery or medical treatment. The time period when symptoms first start and there are changes to the menstrual cycle is called perimenopause. Its duration varies, but it typically lasts a few years, and leads to menopause. Based on evidence, 3% to 8% of people experiencing menopause are estimated to have early menopause (perimenopause starting between 40 and 44 years), and 1% are estimated to have premature ovarian insufficiency (perimenopause starting before 40 years). Menopause can affect people in a variety of ways. Most experience some symptoms, although not everyone seeks treatment. Some people have symptoms that may significantly impact their daily life, and they need treatment, for example, hormone replacement therapy (sometimes called HRT or menopause hormone therapy). Menopause symptoms may last for a long time, with a median duration of 7 years. Common symptoms associated with menopause are vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) and vaginal dryness. In 2019, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) published a drug safety update on hormone replacement therapy based on the Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer's 2019 meta-analysis of type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk, and this guideline takes this update into account.

    "[INTRODUCTION] Series 958 www.thelancet.com Vol 403 March 9, 2024 Menopause 2 Optimising health after early menopause Gita D Mishra, Melanie C Davies, Sarah Hillman, Hsin-Fang Chung, Subho Roy, Kate Maclaran, Martha Hickey The typical age at menopause is 50–51 years in high-income countries. However, early menopause is common, with around 8% of women in high-income countries and 12% of women globally experiencing menopause between the ages of 40 years and 44 years. Menopause before age 40 years (premature ovarian insufficiency) affects an additional 2–4% of women. Both early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency can herald an increased risk of chronic disease, including osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. People who enter menopause at younger ages might also experience distress and feel less supported than those who reach menopause at the average age. Clinical practice guidelines are available for the diagnosis and management of premature ovarian insufficiency, but there is a gap in clinical guidance for early menopause. We argue that instead of distinct age thresholds being applied, early menopause should be seen on a spectrum between premature ovarian insufficiency and menopause at the average age. This Series paper presents evidence for the short-term and long-term consequences of early menopause. We offer a practical framework for clinicians to guide diagnosis and management of early menopause, which considers the nature and severity of symptoms, age and medical history, and the individual’s wishes and priorities to optimise their quality of life and short-term and long-term health. We conclude with recommendations for future research to address key gaps in the current evidence.

    "[INTRODUCTION] timise their quality of life and short-term and long-term health. We conclude with recommendations for future research to address key gaps in the current evidence. Introduction Menopause marks the permanent cessation of menstrual cycles, usually confirmed after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhoea. Natural menopause typically occurs at around age 50–51 years in high-income countries (HICs).1,2 In clinical practice, the onset of menstrual changes and menopausal symptoms generally indicates the start of perimenopause or menopausal transition. While the menopause is marked by the final menstrual period, symptoms can persist for years into the postmenopause.3 Early menopause is usually defined as occurring between the ages of 40 years and 44 years, whereas premature ovarian insufficiency indicates menopause before age 40 years. Both can be either spontaneous or iatrogenic, with iatrogenic causes including bilateral oophorectomy and chemotherapy or pelvic radiation treatment for cancer. In this Series paper, we outline the evidence suggesting that both premature ovarian insufficiency and early menopause are linked with increased risk of chronic conditions in later life, such as cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, although data are generally scarce around early menopause. Similarly, although consensus guidance exists for diagnosing and managing premature ovarian insufficiency, no guidance is available for early menopause. Given the scarcity of specific evidence regarding the long- term health implications of early menopause, we argue that early menopause should be considered as being on a spectrum between premature ovarian insufficiency and the typical age of menopause. To prevent patients from falling through this gap in care, we offer a practical framework to guide diagnosis and management of early menopause and identify evidence-based approaches for individuals either with or at risk of early menopause to optimise their health and quality of life in the short and",
    "[INTRODUCTION] prevent patients from falling through this gap in care, we offer a practical framework to guide diagnosis and management of early menopause and identify evidence-based approaches for individuals either with or at risk of early menopause to optimise their health and quality of life in the short and long term. This process has identified key evidence gaps for further research and areas where people with early menopause require greater support. Menopause happens to all people with typically functioning ovaries who reach the relevant age. We recognise that this population includes some transgender men and other gender-diverse people; therefore, in some instances, we have referred to “people” rather than “women” in order to be as accurate and inclusive as possible. However, since much published work refers to people experiencing menopause collectively as women and does not clarify how findings might apply to the specific needs of gender-diverse people, we have also used “women” in some instances, to avoid inappropriate generalisation. More information is needed about the experience of menopause in transgender men and gender-diverse people.4 Search strategy and selection criteria We conducted a review of published articles up to July, 2023, on the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Lancet 2024; 403: 958–68 Published Online March 5, 2024 https://doi.org/10.1016/ S0140-6736(23)02800-3 See Perspectives pages 893 and 894 This is the second in a Series of four papers about menopause.

Background Biology The pool of primordial follicles is established in utero, with a peak of 6–7 million oocytes at 16–20 weeks’ gestation.5 Most follicles undergo atresia and decline to approximately 700 000 normal oocytes at birth, approximately 300 000 oocytes by menarche, and fewer than 1000 oocytes at menopause.5–7 Both the size of the pool of primordial follicles and the rate of follicular atresia probably determine the timing of menopause, but the underlying mechanisms regulating these factors are poorly understood.8–10 Prevalence of early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency Estimates for the prevalence of spontaneous early meno­ pause and premature ovarian insufficiency vary substantially according to the population studied. The International Collaboration for a Life Course Approach to Reproductive Health and Chronic Disease Events (InterLACE) pooled individual data from over 50 000 women with spontaneous menopause from nine studies in HICs to show that 7·6% of women had early menopause and 2% had premature ovarian insufficiency.11 Global estimates, from a meta-analysis of 31 studies including over 150 000 women with spontaneous menopause, show a higher prevalence of 12·2% (95% CI 10·5–14) for early meno",

A national study in India reported that the prevalence of iatrogenic premature ovarian insufficiency was 1·7%, solely due to bilateral oophorectomy.14 By contrast, a registry-based study (n=1 036 918) from Sweden reported an overall prevalence of 1·9% for spontaneous and iatrogenic premature ovarian insufficiency and, of these women, 10·7% had iatrogenic premature ovarian insufficiency.21 As survival rates for young patients with cancer increase,",
    "[INTRODUCTION] By contrast, a registry-based study (n=1 036 918) from Sweden reported an overall prevalence of 1·9% for spontaneous and iatrogenic premature ovarian insufficiency and, of these women, 10·7% had iatrogenic premature ovarian insufficiency.21 As survival rates for young patients with cancer increase, iatrogenic premature ovarian insufficiency and early menopause will probably increase secondary to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.22 Risk factors for spontaneous early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency Bilateral oophorectomy in premenopausal individuals will induce surgical menopause. Unilateral oophorectomy is also associated with a younger age at menopause, on average 1·8 years younger compared with people with intact ovaries.23 Hysterectomy alone with ovarian preservation is associated with menopause 1·9 years earlier than in women who do not have this procedure.24 The mechanisms underlying spontaneous early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency are poorly understood. Studies in HICs indicate that genetic factors account for roughly half of the variation in age at natural menopause, estimated at 42% of variation in the UK, 44% in the Netherlands, and 52% in the USA.25–27 These data are supported by retrospective studies reporting a six-fold to eight-fold increase in the risk of menopause before age 45 years for women with a maternal history of early menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency.28,29 Recent genome-wide association studies have also identified specific genetic factors linked with the timing of menopause that provide insights on potential causal pathways for ovarian ageing.30 Nulliparity is associated with early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency, although the direction of this relationship is uncertain since there could be shared factors that affect both nulliparity and age at menopause.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] hat provide insights on potential causal pathways for ovarian ageing.30 Nulliparity is associated with early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency, although the direction of this relationship is uncertain since there could be shared factors that affect both nulliparity and age at menopause. The InterLACE consortium found (in a pooled analysis of 51 450 women in nine studies) that nulliparous women were twice as likely to have premature ovarian insufficiency and 30% more likely to have early menopause than women with two or more children.11 Nulliparous women who also had early Series 960 www.thelancet.com Vol 403 March 9, 2024 menarche (before age 12 years) had a five-fold increased risk of premature ovarian insufficiency and double the risk of early menopause, compared with women who had menarche at 12 years or older with two or more children.11 In studies from LMICs, women in India31 and China13 with premature ovarian insufficiency were more likely to have had an earlier age when first giving birth and a shorter duration of breastfeeding, although again the causal pathways at work remain unclear. Globally, cigarette smoking is a well established risk factor for early menopause.13,14,32,33 InterLACE reported that participants who currently smoked were twice as likely to have premature ovarian insufficiency as those who had never smoked, and 80% more likely to have early menopause.34 There was a consistent dose–response relationship for participants who currently smoked and those who formerly smoked (duration and cumulative dose), but those who stopped smoking at least 10 years before menopause had a similar risk of early menopause to individuals who had never smoked. The prevalence of smoking has declined markedly in many HICs over recent decades, but the effect of this decline on rates of early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency has yet to be documented.",

The prevalence of smoking has declined markedly in many HICs over recent decades, but the effect of this decline on rates of early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency has yet to be documented. Implications of early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency Menopausal symptoms The effect of menopause and its symptoms on individuals will be highly contextual.35 Common symptoms directly attributable to menopause include vasomotor symptoms (including hot flushes and night sweats), sleep disturbance, and vaginal dryness.36–38 In addition, some studies have identified depressed mood and aches and joint pain,39 with south Asian and Chinese women (living in HICs) more likely to report joint pain.40,41 The prevalence of moderate- to-severe vasomotor symptoms in natural menopause also varies considerably across populations, with prevalence findings from an international survey ranging from 40% in Europe and 34% in the USA to 16% in Japan.42 Whether menopausal symptoms following early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency differ in nature, severity, or duration compared with symptoms following menopause at the average age is unknown. For iatrogenic early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency, the abrupt cessation of oestrogen is thought to lead to more severe symptoms.43 However, in the only prospective controlled study of surgical menopause, vasomotor symptoms at 12 months affected 82% of individuals who did not take menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), including 68% who reported mild symptoms, suggesting that severe vasomotor symptoms are not inevitable after surgical menopause.44 The diagnosis of menopause from 5 years to a decade or more earlier than expected can carry stigma and might affect self-esteem.45 Symptoms in the years leading up to menopause can affect intimate relationships and, for some people, the loss of fertility can be especially dist",

The experience of menopausal symptoms can affect not only an individual’s quality of life but also their effectiveness in the workplace, with economic consequences due to lower workforce participation rates.46–48 For example, a 2022 study from the UK found that women with early menopause had lower labour market participation at age 50 years than other women.47 For individuals with iatrogenic early menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency, the change in circulating sex steroid concentrations occurs suddenly, and often in the context of treatment burden (eg, from chemotherapy) for a recent disease diagnosis, such as breast cancer. Some studies of women with iatrogenic premature ovarian insufficiency report low social support,49 moderate-to-severe emotional distress,50 and high rates of depression.51 Although studies are scarce, some of these adverse outcomes could plausibly apply to people with menopause in their early 40s. Longer-term health implications Bone health Oestrogens contribute to the regulation of bone resorption and formation.10 Women with premature ovarian insufficiency and early menopause are at increased risk of fragility fractures. A cross-sectional study of 4725 women from the Netherlands found that those with spontaneous early menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency had a 50% higher overall fracture rate up to age 80 years compared with those with menopause at the average age.52 Similar findings are reported in prospective studies from Sweden (osteoporosis and fragility fracture by age 77 years)53 and the Netherlands (vertebral fractures at age 62 years).54 Cardiovascular disease Since the late 1980s, cardiovascular risk has been thought",

People with early menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency are at increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular disease-related mortality.55–57 Pooled data from 15 studies (from Australia, Japan, Scandinavia, the UK, and the USA) show that women with spontaneous early menopause had a 30% increased risk (and women with premature ovarian insufficiency had a 55% increased risk) of a cardiovascular disease event compared with individuals with menopause at age 50–54 years, although these risks attenuated over time, with no difference found by age 70 years.58 Women with surgical early menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency were at an even higher relative risk (60% and 90%, respectively) for cardiovascular disease events.59 Findings from the UK Biobank study show both spontaneous and iatrogenic premature ovarian insufficiency are associated with increased risk of Series www.thelancet.com Vol 403 March 9, 2024 961 hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, compared with menopause at the average age.60 Mental health and neurological conditions Unfortunately, little is known about early menopause and mental health. Premature ovarian insufficiency might negatively affect mental health in the short and long term. A meta-analysis of four studies with 3033 women with spontaneous premature ovarian insufficiency found that they were twice as likely to develop depression compared with women with menopause at age 40 years or older.61 In a retrospective UK study of 136 women with premature ovarian insufficiency, 78% reported a nega",

Surgical menopause at or before age 45 years has been associated with higher risk of dementia and faster overall cognitive decline,63 but the specific relationship between early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency and neurological conditions is less clear. A cohort study based on the Korean National Health Insurance System database (with prospective data on 4·7 million post- menopausal women) reported that early menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency was associated with all- cause dementia, with the risk declining as age at menopause increased.64 In a French population cohort study (n=4868), however, no association was found between early menopause and a decline in cognitive function in later life (tested across multiple domains), whereas both surgical and spontaneous premature ovarian insufficiency were linked with a decline in verbal fluency and visual memory.65 Oestrogen-sensitive cancers Breast cancer is the most common cancer in HICs, and most breast cancers are oestrogen-sensitive. Women with menopause before age 45 years are at lower relative risk of breast cancer (by 27% for early menopause and 33% for premature ovarian insufficiency),66,67 and at lower risk for endometrial and ovarian cancers compared with women with menopause at age 50–54 years.10,66 Life expectancy Overall the evidence indicates that earlier natural meno­ pause is associated with higher all-cause mortality,68 and this r",

A meta-analysis of seven studies found that premature ovarian insufficiency was linked with a 40% increased relative risk (RR; 95% CI 1·10–1·77) of all-cause mortality, whereas for women with early menopause the association was limited to a small increased risk of ischaemic heart disease (RR 1·09, 1·00–1·18).69 A large US study of women with natural menopause who did not smoke and had not had MHT70 found that early menopause was linked with a 9% increased relative risk of death due to coronary heart disease and a 19% increased risk for respiratory disease, which were the two main contributors to a small but identifiable increased risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1·04, 95% CI 1·00–1·08). Similarly, a large Canadian study of prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy71 found that women with iatrogenic early menopause had a higher likelihood of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1·16, 95% CI 1·04–1·30) and this association increased further for those with iatrogenic premature ovarian insufficiency (1·31, 1·18–1·45) compared with women who had this surgery at age 50–55 years. This study included women both with and without hormone therapy, and for both the early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency groups the association with all-cause mortality was largely driven by deaths from causes other than cancer.71 Diagnosis and management of early menopause The initial challenge for health professionals is to make the diagnosis of early menopause and to explain the condition and potential consequences.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] oups the association with all-cause mortality was largely driven by deaths from causes other than cancer.71 Diagnosis and management of early menopause The initial challenge for health professionals is to make the diagnosis of early menopause and to explain the condition and potential consequences. Most international guidelines advise offering MHT to individuals without contraindications following early menopause.72–74 MHT is highly effective for short-term symptoms, but it has not been shown to improve long-term health outcomes. Early menopause has implications for fertility, contraception, and potentially for sexual function. Addressing the psychological needs of people with early menopause and offering long-term follow-up and support is crucial.45,50,75 Diagnosis The diagnosis of early menopause might not be straightforward unless a clear iatrogenic cause is identified. In individuals with spontaneous early menopause presenting with secondary amenorrhoea, vasomotor symptoms, or both, investigations are indicated to establish the diagnosis.76 Some people will be amenorrhoeic after hysterectomy with ovarian conservation, or while taking long-acting progestogen contraception, so the diagnosis is made on the basis of symptoms and biochemistry. There are no consensus criteria for diagnosing early menopause after cancer treatment, which can cause transient or fluctuating symptoms. Although evidence on early menopause diagnoses is scarce, some studies report that people with premature ovarian insufficiency might experience delayed diagnosis. In a US study,77 more than half of women with spontaneous premature ovarian insufficiency reported seeing three different clinicians, and for 25% of the women, establishing a diagnosis took over 5 years.",

In a US study,77 more than half of women with spontaneous premature ovarian insufficiency reported seeing three different clinicians, and for 25% of the women, establishing a diagnosis took over 5 years. Similarly, for 25% of Australian women with premature ovarian insufficiency, diagnosis was delayed for more than 2 years and most saw at least two clinicians.51 As a result, some individuals might be categorised as having early menopause rather than premature ovarian insufficiency. Most women receiving a diagnosis of spontaneous premature ovarian insufficiency Series 962 www.thelancet.com Vol 403 March 9, 2024 are dissatisfied with the clinical interaction,50 but we do not know the views of people diagnosed with early menopause. For both groups, navigating treatment entails further complexity as patients grapple with the risks and efficacy of hormonal and non-hormonal therapies.78 Treatment options Lifestyle interventions Advice on healthy lifestyles should be a routine part of clinical interactions with health professionals and is particularly relevant for people experiencing early menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency. In these patients, the aims should be reducing cardiovascular risk (eg, through smoking cessation) and promoting bone health (eg, through weight-bearing exercise and a calcium- rich diet).2 Non-hormonal treatments Complementary and alternative remedies are widely marketed and used for vasomotor symptoms.79 There is a lack of evidence for the efficacy of herbal treatments and dietary supplements to relieve vasomotor symptoms, with the possible exception of isoflavones and black cohosh, and findings of studies might not translate into clinical practice, as preparations vary considerably.76,80 Psychological interventions, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy, reduce the effects of vasomotor symptoms and improve sleep and mood disturbance general",

Bisphosphonates are not generally used in spontaneous early menopause but can be given in oncology practice, particularly when oestrogen is contraindicated.89 Hormonal treatments In the general population, MHT is highly effective in relieving some symptoms of menopause with a dose- dependent response, and it is generally prescribed as physiological oestradiol-based preparations.80 Oestrogen is given in combination with progestogen to avoid unscheduled bleeding and the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, unless individuals have undergone hyster­ ectomy.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] of menopause with a dose- dependent response, and it is generally prescribed as physiological oestradiol-based preparations.80 Oestrogen is given in combination with progestogen to avoid unscheduled bleeding and the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, unless individuals have undergone hyster­ ectomy. A combined oral contraceptive might be a convenient and acceptable preparation for young people with premature ovarian insufficiency, although the relative efficacy of this treatment compared with MHT, for both short-term and long-term outcomes, is unclear. Serious adverse effects from a combined oral contraceptive are rare but increase with age,75,90 so MHT is preferred for early menopause. Systemic treatment can be given orally or transdermally, the latter having metabolic advantages. Topical (intravaginal) treatment is effective in relieving urogenital symptoms and might be required in addition to MHT;75 endometrial protection is not required with topical oestrogen. Oestrogen replacement is recommended following both premature ovarian insufficiency and early menopause until the typical age of menopause,74,91 but the optimum duration of use is uncertain. Although oestrogen treatment is often initiated for symptom control, longer-term use is advised in the expectation of improved health outcomes. The adverse health effects of early menopause are less severe than those of premature ovarian insufficiency, as would be expected given the relative duration and degree of oestrogen loss.58,68,92 There might, therefore, be fewer potential health benefits from MHT for early menopause than for premature ovarian insufficiency.

Prevention of osteoporosis and the maintenance of bone health is a major rationale for the use of MHT following premature ovarian insufficiency.2 Clinical guidance is extrapolated from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) data, which showed that MHT in older postmenopausal women improves bone mineral density and reduces vertebral and hip fracture risk.93,94 However, fractures are uncommon in women younger than 45 years (the association between low bone mineral density and fracture is age-dependent, mediated by falls).95 There are a few small prospective studies showing the benefit of MHT on bone health in premature ovarian insufficiency.2 However, bone health in early menopause specifically has not been sufficiently studied. Early cohort studies suggested that MHT might have a role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women but this role was not confirmed by large randomised trials.96,97 The largest trial (the WHI) showed an increase in the risk of ischaemic heart disease and stroke in people taking oestrogen.97,98 However, a subgroup analysis of women aged 50–59 years showed some risk reduction in coronary heart disease and mortality with MHT.99,100 Although a Cochrane review found reduced risk for coronary heart disease for women who started MHT less than 10 years after the menopause (RR 0·52, 95% CI 0·29–0·96), it confirmed an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (1·74, 1·11–2·73), and Series www.thelancet.com Vol 403 March 9, 2024 963 was unable to support the use of MHT for primary or secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.99 Findings from the analysis of pooled data from InterLACE59 only detected a reduction in risk in cardiovascu",

A study of women in the USA with bilateral oophorectomy before age 45 years101 found that those receiving MHT had no evidence of increased mortality from cardiovascular disease compared with women from the same age group who did not have bilateral oophorectomy, whereas those who had not taken MHT were at increased risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1·84, 95% CI 1·27–2·68), compared with women from the same age group who did not have bilateral oophorectomy.101 There are no RCTs of MHT, however, in women with early menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency. Concern was raised by the Women’s Health Initiative study’s findings of an increased risk of dementia in older users of MHT, which might reflect the thrombotic risk of MHT.102 There is very little information, however, on the effect of oestrogen treatment on cognitive function in younger people with early menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency. A population-based cohort study of women aged at least 65 years found that both spontaneous and surgical premature ovarian insufficiency were associated with poorer cognitive function in later life,65 but found no evidence of a cognitive benefit from MHT. Risk of breast cancer is slightly increased in healthy premenopausal women with long-term use of a combined oral contraceptive103,104 and is increased in older postmenopausal women taking combined MHT.105,106 However, the type of MHT is important: long-term follow-up from participants in the Women’s Health Initiative study showed a reduction in brea",

For women with early menopause starting MHT aged 40–44 years, observational data suggest that the increase in breast cancer risk is similar to that in women with menopause at the average age.106 Few women in long-term observational studies started MHT before the age of 40 years, although these women are at increased risk after more than 15 years of MHT use.106 There are no randomised data relating to breast cancer risk in early menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency. Optimising health outcomes for women with early menopause Clinical guidelines Existing clinical practice guidelines for menopause management rarely address early menopause. A systematic review of 22 current guidelines109 found that some include premature ovarian insufficiency but have little advice in relation to early menopause. For example, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on the diagnosis and management of menopause include some recommendations on premature ovarian insufficiency and address the diagnosis of early menopause but not its management.76 The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology published specific pre­ mature ovarian insufficiency guidelines in 2015, but has no clinical guidelines for early menopause.2 In 2014, Jane and Davis110 produced a practitioner toolkit for managing menopause in women aged 40 years and older on the basis of recommendations in position statements and practice g",
    "[INTRODUCTION] specific pre­ mature ovarian insufficiency guidelines in 2015, but has no clinical guidelines for early menopause.2 In 2014, Jane and Davis110 produced a practitioner toolkit for managing menopause in women aged 40 years and older on the basis of recommendations in position statements and practice guidelines. Building on this model, we have, in turn, developed a practical clinical framework to assist with diagnosis and management of early menopause (figure). Management recommendations are limited by the scarcity of evidence relating specifically to early menopause. However, the boundaries between typical menopause, early menopause, and premature ovarian insufficiency are arbitrary, and age cutoffs are often crossed in clinical practice during the lengthy process of menopause transi­ tion. Early menopause occupies a zone between premature ovarian insufficiency and menopause at the typical age, so extrapolating from existing studies in these groups while awaiting further targeted studies seems reasonable. People with early menopause should be aware of the potential long-term risks, including osteoporosis, fractures, and cardiovascular disease. Ensuring this awareness provides an opportunity for a broader discussion on the key role of health behaviours (eg, smoking cessation, healthy diet, healthy bodyweight, and exercise) for cardiometabolic health and maintenance of bone density. Clinicians might also see opportunities to address specific risk factors. Individualised care Considerable scope exists to provide a more holistic and individualised approach to the management of early menopause. This approach could be part of a broader attitude to reproductive health that ideally engages with individuals, especially those at risk of early menopause, well before the menopausal transition.111 For example, discussion of early menopause should be part of consultations with individuals with BRCA1/2 mutations, which place them at high risk of breast and ovarian cancer, who might",

Improving community information on early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency and natural menopause could aid prompt diagnoses. Social media is often a primary source of health information for women112 and there is a need for objective and evidence- based online resources. For example, a co-designed digital health resource for women with early menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency and health practitioners targets these unmet needs for information Series 964 www.thelancet.com Vol 403 March 9, 2024 and support management.113 Clinical guidelines should now routinely be translated into lay terms, allowing patients direct access to high-quality information. Future recommendations Reducing the risk of early menopause The incidence of iatrogenic early menopause can be reduced by changes in the management of benign gynaecological conditions (eg, hysterectomy rates have reduced since the introduction of intrauterine progestogen devices), and by modifications in oncology practice (eg, the use of less gonadotoxic chemotherapy regimens). Research priorities There are substantial gaps in our knowledge of the cause, natural history, and optimal management of early Figure: Practical framework for diagnosis, evaluation, and management of early menopause FSH=follicle-stimulating hormone.

TSH=thyroid-stimulating hormone. *Might not be apparent if the individual is taking hormonal contraception or has had a previous hysterectomy. †Symptoms of menopause can vary between individuals and in the same individual over time. Some people have no symptoms apart from cessation of menstruation. Symptoms such as mood disturbances, anxiety, brain fog, palpitations, and low libido are common but might not be attributable to menopause. ‡Intermenstrual or post-coital bleeding needs further investigation; also consider further investigation for heavier bleeding. §A raised FSH concentration is confirmation of a diagnosis, but a typical FSH concentration does not rule out perimenopause. If uncertain, repeat testing might be needed. This test can guide contraceptive needs. FSH is of no value while the individual is taking combined oral contraception, and of limited value if they are taking any hormonal treatment. ¶For example, Healthtalk Australia’s digital resource on early menopause and the Daisy Network Individual aged 40–45 years presenting with: Menstrual irregularity* or secondary amenorrhoea* and any of the following symptoms†: • Vasomotor symptoms, • Poor sleep, • Dyspareunia, • Vaginal dryness, • Urinary symptoms, or • Joint pain and stiﬀness Examination and screening • Measure height and weight and BMI • Measure blood pressure • Breast and pelvic examinations are not routinely required • Check patient’s knowledge of breast self-examination and cancer screening (breast and cervix) Initial investigations • FSH§ • TSH if clinically indicated • Cardiovascular risk proﬁle if clinically indicated • Bone densitometry if clinically indicated Consider (or rule out) other causes of menstrual disturbance • Pregnancy • Polycystic ovarian syndrome • Low bodyweight or excessive exercise • Medication Clinical evaluation Change in bleeding pattern‡ • >12 months of amenorrhoea (probably menopause) • <12 months o",

There are also important evidence gaps for both premature ovarian insufficiency and early menopause in LMICs, particular around under- reporting.114,115 Governments should be encouraged to look beyond reproductive and child health programmes and consider the health consequences of ageing and management of associated conditions, such as menopause. With the shift to routine digital health management, there might be new opportunities to collect detailed data on the diagnosis and management of early menopause. Similarly, the rise of digital health hubs on early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency provides considerable research opportunities to engage with people on their menopausal experiences and evaluate the effect of information strategies on subsequent treatment choices.

    "[INTRODUCTION] t treatment choices. In summary, approximately 8–10% of women globally experience early menopause, but the causes, natural history, and potential long-term health outcomes are poorly understood. In particular, whether MHT confers long-term health benefits for people with early menopause is unclear. Information on early menopause is largely extrapolated from existing evidence on premature ovarian insufficiency or from studies of menopause at the average age. Interpretation of this evidence assumes a spectrum of age at menopause, with consequences reflecting the timing and duration of oestrogen withdrawal. Unfortunately, there is insufficient evidence for current guidance advising MHT until the average age at menopause (ie, 50 years) and so treatment should be considered on an individualised basis. Clinicians and researchers should work with people experiencing early menopause to establish their personal priorities for research and wishes for treatment.

We review evidence from prospective studies reporting on associations between mental health conditions and the menopause transition. Major depressive disorder and the more prevalent subthreshold depressive symptoms are the most common conditions studied. We reviewed 12 prospective studies reporting depressive symptoms, major depressive disorder, or both over the menopause transition and found no compelling evidence for a universal increased risk for either condition. However, specific subgroups of participants, primarily defined by menopause-related risk factors (ie, vasomotor symptoms that are severe or disturb sleep, a long duration of the transition, or reproductive hormone dynamics) and psychosocial risk factors (eg, stressful life events), were vulnerable to depressive symptoms. The increased risk of major depressive disorder over the menopause transition appears predominantly in individuals with previous major depressive disorder. Greater focus on recognising risk factors in primary care is warranted. On the basis of scarce data, we found no compelling evidence that risk of anxiety, bipolar disorder, or psychosis is universally elevated over the menopause transition.

Potential misattribution of psychological distress and psychiatric disorders to menopause could harm women by delaying accurate diagnosis and the initiation of effective psychotropic treatments, and by creating negative expectations for people approaching menopause. A paradigm shift is needed. We conclude with recommendations for the detection and treatment of depressive symptoms or major depressive disorder and strategies to promote good mental health over the menopause transition, while responsibly preparing and supporting those at risk. Introduction The menopause transition usually starts around age 47 years with the onset of menstrual changes and ends at the final menstrual period.1 Perimenopause is a related term. Perimenopause includes the menopause transition and the 12 months following the final menstrual period (early postmenopausal stage). The attribution of psychological distress to the menopause in high-income countries is long-standing. In 1816, Charles-Pierre-Louis de Gardanne included “hysteria, or nervous affection of the uterus” as a typical symptom of the menopause.2 In 1959, Kupperman, Wetchler, and Blatt described the menopause as a “rather unpleasant and possibly dangerous”3 period of life, and developed the first widely used menopause symptom checklist.4 Notably, this scale, the 11-item Blatt– Kupperman Index, includes psychological symptoms such as melancholia and nervousness, informing the inclusion of psychological symptoms in contemporary menopause rating scales.5,6 Although this approach has raised the profile of mental health conditions requiring care, it might also have contributed to the widespread belief that the menopause transition is universally associated with poor mental health. Anxiety,7,8 paranoid thinking,9 schizophrenic psychosis,10 and even suicidality11,12 have been attributed to the menopause, yet the empirical evidence to support these claims has not been subject to rigorous scientific review.",

Anxiety,7,8 paranoid thinking,9 schizophrenic psychosis,10 and even suicidality11,12 have been attributed to the menopause, yet the empirical evidence to support these claims has not been subject to rigorous scientific review. This Series paper has three objectives. First, we review findings from prospective studies investigating the association between the menopause transition and risk of mental health symptoms and disorders, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and suicide risk. Second, since most research has focused on the relationship between the menopause transition and the risk of depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder, we contextualise these findings and explore vulnerability factors that help explain why some subgroups of people are at risk of depressive symptoms Lancet 2024; 403: 969–83 Published Online March 5, 2024 https://doi.org/10.1016/ S0140-6736(23)02801-5 See Perspectives pages 893 and 894 This is the third in a Series of four papers about menopause.

Third, we conclude with recommendations for the detection and treatment of depressive symptoms or major depressive disorder and strategies to promote mental health over the menopause transition. Menopause happens to all people with typically functioning ovaries who reach the relevant age. We recognise that this population includes some transgender men and other gender-diverse people; therefore, in this Series, we sometimes refer to “people” rather than “women” in order to be as accurate and inclusive as possible. However, since much published work refers to people experiencing menopause collectively as women and does not clarify how findings might apply to the specific needs of gender-diverse people, we have also used “women” in some instances, to avoid inappropriate generalisation. More information is needed about the experience of menopause in transgender men and gender-diverse people.13 Search strategy and selection criteria We searched the databases MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycInfo from Jan 1, 1990, to July 1, 2023.

For sections reporting on the absolute and relative risk of mental health symptoms or disorders over the menopause transition, we limited our review a priori to cohort studies with more than 100 participants for whom prospective data on the risk of mental health symptoms or disorders in the menopause transition compared with before the menopause transition (ie, premenopause) were available. When a prospective study reported data in more than one paper, we have reported findings from the most comprehensive study with the largest sample size or longest follow-up period. Findings were cross-checked against relevant meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and clinical guidelines. In sections reporting on risk factors and recommendations, we prioritised findings from prospective studies, clinical guidelines, and recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Findings from prospective studies Depression An association between the menopause and depression is widely promoted. Highly cited papers state a doubled to quadrupled risk of depressive symptoms or depressive disorders over the menopause transition.7,14,15 However, most papers report the relative risk rather than the absolute risk. Furthermore, studies have often not adequately distinguished between depressive symptoms and depressive disorder. Generally, depressive symptoms are more prevalent, less debilitating, and do not constitute a clinical depressive disorder, the most common and burdensome of which is major depressive disorder (symptoms does not necessarily imply that a person is experiencing a depressive episode.19 Self-report scales typically include generic symptoms, such as sleep problems, appetite disturbance, and fatig",

Hence, our understanding of the risk of major depressive disorder over the menopause transition assessed uniformly by clinical interviews is limited to data from 600 women globally. Major depressive disorder Major depressive disorder affects approximately 6% of the global population each year and is diagnosed twice as often in women as in men.16 The mechanisms underlying this sex difference are poorly understood, but changes in endogenous sex steroid hormones have been identified as a contributory factor.1 The menopause transition is marked by changes in circulating sex steroids compared with before the menopause transition (premenopause).37 Specifically, oestradiol variability is more marked during the early menopause transition, and then progesterone production reduces then stops as ovulation ceases in the late menopause transition.1 The menopause transition often coincides with substa",
    "[INTRODUCTION] before the menopause transition (premenopause).37 Specifically, oestradiol variability is more marked during the early menopause transition, and then progesterone production reduces then stops as ovulation ceases in the late menopause transition.1 The menopause transition often coincides with substantial midlife stresses, health conditions, and role transitions, which increase individuals’ vulnerability to depression.20 One prospective study suggests that women with a previous history of major depressive disorder are at increased risk of recurrence over the menopause transition. The Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Mental Health substudy (n=425)20 reported a 2·67-fold increased risk of major depressive disorder recurrence over the menopause transition (95% CI 1·04–6·86; p=0·04).20 However, there was no increased risk of first lifetime episodes of major depressive disorder. First-onset major depressive disorder was predicted by risk factors unrelated to the menopause transition, such as trait anxiety, low physical functioning, and physical illness. Over 30 years, the longitudinal Zurich Study (n=168)23 measured the prevalence of major depressive disorder at age 41 years and again at age 50 years. They found no increase in major depressive disorder in people who became perimenopausal or postmenopausal over this period, although only 27% of the sample group had reached postmenopause at follow- up and, unlike SWAN, this study did not include annual assessments of reproductive stage and mood. In summary, the few available prospective data suggest that the menopause transition might be a vulnerable period for the recurrence of major depressive disorder but not for first lifetime onset of this condition.

Less is known about the prevalence of depressive symptoms during the menopause transition in low- income and middle-income countries. Of the 12 prospective studies tracking changes in depressive symptoms across the menopause transition, only one, the PALM study from China,35 was not conducted in a high-income country. The remaining studies were conducted in the USA (n=6), Europe (n=2), Australia (n=2), and Canada (n=1). The PALM study found a prevalence of depressive symptoms of 14·5% in the premenopause (baseline), which rose slightly to 18·2% during the menopause transition and to 19·6% in the postmenopause. These differences were not statistically significant. Of the 12 prospective studies that have considered the relative risk of depressive symptoms during the menopause transition compared with the premenopause, two15,26 reported increased depressive symptoms, and three23,34,35 found no association. The remaining seven studies reported mixed results. Four identified specific subgroups as being at risk of depressive symptoms, including people with a combination of vasomotor symptoms and adverse life events in the 6 months before assessment,14 people with a hysterectomy,33 people without a history of probable major depressive disorder,31 and people with a longer duration of the menopause transition.30 One study found an association contingent on time spent in the menopause transition.28 Women who remained perimenopausal across recurrent surveys had a higher risk of depressive symptoms.",

SWAN26,27 followed over 3000 women in the USA for more than 13 years and found an increase in depressive symptoms during the menopause transition (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·68, 95% CI 1·28–2·20).26 At the 8-year follow-up in women who were aged 35–47 years and premenopausal at baseline,15 POAS15,25 found that the menopause transition more than quadrupled the risk of depressive symptoms (OR 4·29, 95% CI 2·39–7·72). Taken in isolation, this result suggests a substantial risk of depressive symptoms that could be alarming for women and their clinicians. However, in women with no previous depressive disorder, a minority (10–30%) reported clinically significant depressive symptoms across both the late premenopause and menopause transition, with no obvious increase in depressive symptoms in the years preceding the final menstrual period (previous major depressive disorder reported depressive symptoms over late premenopause and the menopause transition.

PATH31 found an association overall, but in subgroup analyses only individuals without a history of probable major depressive disorder were at increased risk of more symptoms of depression during the menopause transition (incidence rate ratio 1·35, 95% CI 1·08–1·68).

In summary, on the basis of mixed findings from prospective studies, we found no compelling evidence for a universal or uniform increased risk of depressive symptoms over the menopause transition. Greater awareness of risk factors might inform an understanding of the mechanisms underlying depressive symptoms in subgroups of women and provide new opportunities for prevention and treatment. Anxiety Associations between the menopause transition and anxiety are poorly understood.40 One prospective study measuring anxiety disorders found no increase over the menopause transition.23 Four prospective studies have measured changes in anxiety symptoms over the menopause transition, with mixed results (appendix p 1). Two studies found no increase in anxiety symptoms over the menopause transition.23,35 In contrast, the SWAN41 and PATH31 studies found that people with low anxiety in the premenopause were at risk of increased anxiety symptoms during the menopause transition. The SWAN study controlled for vasomotor symptoms, which is important since symptoms of menopause can overlap with symptoms of anxiety, such as sweating, a racing heart, and rapid breathing. Findings from POAS suggest that anxiety exacerbates vasomotor symptoms. Women with physical symptoms of anxiety were at increased risk of developing moderate or severe vasomotor symptoms over the menopause transition.42 In China, the PALM study43 found a bidirectional longitudinal relationship between symptoms of anxiety and bother due to vasomotor symptoms, suggesting that anxiety could be both a cause and consequence of vasomotor symptoms.

In summary, there is no consistent evidence that anxiety increases over the menopause transition. However, somatic anxiety might predict moderate or severe vasomotor symptoms, suggesting that reducing anxiety might reduce bother from vasomotor symptoms and is a potential target for intervention. Other mental health disorders Bipolar disorder No prospective studies have investigated psychiatric symptoms over the menopause transition in people with bipolar disorder. One small study (n=47) found that depressive episodes (but not mood elevation) measured prospectively over the menopause transition were increased compared with retrospective self-reports of premenopausal depressive episode frequency.44 A systematic review of nine cross-sectional or retrospective studies reported an increase in symptoms of bipolar disorder over the menopause transition, largely on the basis of retrospective self-reports.45 The largest of these studies found that 25·9% (57 of 220) of participants with bipolar 1 disorder retrospectively self-reported having “perimenopausal mood symptoms”, compared with 12·5% (7 of 56) of their relatives without a diagnosed mood disorder.46 Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders It has been widely suggested that the menopause transition is a vulnerable period for new onset or recurrent episodes of schizophrenic psychosis,10 however empirical evidence supporting this claim is scarce.

We found no prospective studies investigating rates of psychotic symptoms or disorders over the menopause transition. A meta-analysis of 83 studies found that women but not men experience a small increase in first lifetime onset psychosis after age 45 years.47 These data informed the oestrogen hypothesis, which suggests that a decline in oestrogens across the menopause transition might trigger psychosis in women.10 A large (n=61 889) Finnish study48 found that women with schizophrenia-spectrum See Online for appendix Series 976 www.thelancet.com Vol 403 March 9, 2024 disorders were more often hospitalised for psychosis after age 45 years than men were.48 However, oestrogen withdrawal does not occur uniformly at this age and circulating oestradiol concentrations in the early menopause transition can be markedly elevated in a woman’s late 40s.49 The mean age of onset of schizophrenic psychosis is 20–40 years when oestradiol concentrations are generally high (appendix p 4). Suicidality and the menopause transition The risk of suicide is higher in men than in women across the lifespan, and midlife is a time of elevated suicide risk for both sexes.50,51 Recent media reports have suggested that women are at elevated risk of suicide over the menopause transition.11,12 However, there is no substantive evidence of an association between attempted or completed suicide and the menopause transition.

One cross-sectional study from Korea (n=45 177)52 showed increased suicidal ideation (thoughts about wanting to die in the past year) during the menopause transition (prevalence of 7·2% compared with a premenopause prevalence of 5·73%). Although the study measured self- reported rates of suicide attempts, no relationship between these rates and reproductive stage was reported.52 A US study of 298 women in treatment for mood disorders found no association between reproductive stage and suicidal ideation or attempts.53 One longitudinal study (n=291 709) in US veterans54 found that use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) was associated with significantly increased risk of attempted and completed suicide over the next 4·5 years. These associations with death by suicide remained significant after accounting for psychiatric comorbidity and psychoactive medications.54 In summary, despite claims that the menopause transition is associated with increased risk of suicide, empirical data to support these claims are scarce. However, some evidence suggests that use of MHT is associated with suicide attempts and completion. The reasons for this association are uncertain. Who is at risk of experiencing depressive symptoms or disorders over the menopause transition? Large prospective studies report that a small subgroup of about 5–9%28,55 of women experience increasing depressive symptoms over midlife, whereas a similar proportion (8·5–11%)28,55 report decreasing depressive symptoms.

Menopause-specific and general risk and resilience factors might help explain why a subgroup of women could be at risk of depressive symptoms or disorders over the menopause transition. Established psychosocial risk factors for depressive symptoms Prospective studies confirm that established psychosocial stressors such as financial problems,29 unemployment,29 poor social support,26 and stressful life events29,32 are important predictors of depressive symptoms during the menopause transition.23,29,26 Similarly, adverse childhood experiences,56 being from a minority ethnic group,25 higher BMI,15,29 neuroticism,23 and lifestyle behaviours (eg, smoking and lack of physical activity)26 are also associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms. Emerging evidence suggests that psychosocial factors can interact with sex steroid hormones to modify mood. A prospective study (n=52)57 found that greater variability in serially measured oestradiol over 14 months predicted greater depressive symptoms, but only in individuals with very stressful life events in the 6 months before baseline assessment, suggesting an interaction between established risk factors for depression and endocrine changes over the menopause transition. Menopause-related factors Type and timing of menopause The type (natural or surgical) and timing of menopause might influence the risk of depressive symptoms.

    "[INTRODUCTION] natural or surgical) and timing of menopause might influence the risk of depressive symptoms. Prospective studies show that surgical menopause (ie, from bilateral oophorectomy before natural menopause) confers greater risk58–60 than hysterectomy alone.58,59 However, the effects might be transitory. A prospective controlled study of depressive symptoms and anxiety following surgical menopause showed a doubling in new-onset depressive symptoms at 12 months, which had resolved by 24 months.61 Abrupt changes in sex steroid hormones following oophorectomy might contribute to this effect. However, women undergoing surgical menopause commonly have other risk factors for depression, such as adverse childhood experiences, abuse, and chronic pelvic pain.62 Similarly, women with spontaneous premature63 or early64 menopause are at increased risk of depressive symptoms, but are more likely to have experienced cancer treatment, infertility, and gynaecological pathology than women who have menopause at the average age. Hence, factors other than endocrine changes might influence mood for these subgroups. Longer duration of the menopause transition has also been associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms,28,30,60 potentially explained by extended time with vasomotor symptoms.30 Vasomotor symptoms and sleep disturbance A systematic review of 33 publications65 reported that the presence and frequency of vasomotor symptoms were bidirectionally associated with depressive symptoms.65 Some women are more bothered by vasomotor symptoms than others and this variability might relate to mood, stress, and the degree of sleep disturbance. The extent to which vasomotor symptoms are problematic or interfere with daily life predicts mood disturbance and quality of life more than vasomotor symptom frequency does.66 A pooled analysis of longitudinal data from over 20 000 women found that sleep disturbance largely Series www.thelancet.com Vol 403 March 9, 2024 977 accounted for the associa",

Sex steroids Oestradiol variability,15,57,69,70 low progesterone con­cen­ tration,70 and change in the ratio of testosterone concentration to oestradiol concentration71 have been associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms, but findings vary and these associations have not been consistently replicated.26,32,72,73 Prospective studies with annual measures of oestradiol concentration and mood found no associations with depressive symptoms,26,32,73 and cross-sectional studies report no differences in oestradiol concentrations in perimenopausal women with a depressive disorder compared with those without.74 However, epidemiological15,57 and repeated-measures69,70 studies with more frequent assessments report that greater oestradiol variability is associated with worse mood. Circulating progesterone is reduced over the menopause transition. One study found that low progesterone concentrations were associated with worse mood.70 Some women might be more mood-sensitive to changes in oestradiol concentrations than others,75,76 as was shown for women with previous major depressive disorder during the menopause transition who experienced a relapse of symptoms when MHT was withdrawn.75 Together, these data suggest that greater oestradiol variability and pos",

However, there are no established ways of predicting vulnerability to depressed mood following fluctuations in ovarian sex steroids. Psychosocial and cultural aspects of menopause Psychosocial and cultural factors shape mental health over the menopause transition. Negative expectations and attitudes towards menopause (eg, “[d]uring the menopause or the change of life, I became, or expect to become, irritable or depressed”)27 and ageing60 (eg, worry about physical decline) predict subsequent depressive symptoms. Most women experience vasomotor symptoms. Together with predisposing factors such as anxiety, people with more negative attitudes towards menopause might have unhelpful cognitive appraisals of vasomotor symptoms (eg, thinking that people will notice their hot flashes or that their symptoms will never end), which might increase their distress and amplify the effects of these symptoms on their mood and functioning.77 By contrast, positive coping strategies might minimise the effect of vasomotor symptoms on mood. There are marked global differences in attitudes towards menopause, which might help to explain the variation in attributed symptoms across different cultures.78 For example, White Australians report higher rates of depressive symptoms together with fears of ageing than Laotian women, who position menopause as a positive event.79 Optimising mental health at menopause Identifying modifiable factors is essential to inform preventive interventions.",

Managing troublesome vasomotor symptoms and sleep disturbance might reduce the risk of depressive symptoms and possibly major depressive disorder. Effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for vasomotor symptoms are widely available.80 Evidence-based information promoting more positive or neutral attitudes towards ageing and menopause might be helpful (panel). Increasing social support and physical activity are other potentially modifiable targets.55 Furthermore, a systematic review has identified psychological resources including optimism, healthy self-image, and perceived control as being protective of mental health across the menopause transition.81 Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is a proven intervention for depression and anxiety across life stages and is effective for sleep disturbance and for vasomotor symptoms. CBT is specifically recommended by UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for depressed mood during menopause.82 The North American Menopause Society 2023 guidelines also recommend CBT for bothersome vasomotor symptoms.83 In summary, women with previous major depressive disorder might be at elevated risk of recurrence over the menopause transition. Vulnerability to depressive symptoms includes both established psychosocial risk factors and menopause-specific factors, which might interact ( Detection and treatment of depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder over the menopause transition A US survey of trainee physicians84 found that only 6·8% felt adequately prepared to address menopause, despite recognising the importance of this life stage.84 Understanding the associations between menopause a",

Detection The approach to diagnosis and management of depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder over the menopause transition should mirror that at other life stages.85 Because the menopause transition is a risk period for recurrence of major depressive disorder, women with previous experience of this condition require Series 978 www.thelancet.com Vol 403 March 9, 2024 vigilant monitoring during this life stage. Although the menopause transition is not a risk period for first lifetime onset major depressive disorder, UK guidelines86 recommend being alert to depression across adulthood and considering screening. During the menopause transition, clinicians should consider risk factors for mental illness, including previous history, and both established psychosocial and menopause-related risk factors ( Prevention RCTs have considered psychosocial87,88 and hormonal interventions76 for the primary prevention of depressive symptoms or disorders over the menopause transition. Mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) is an 8-week group intervention designed to ameliorate stress through mindfulness meditation and yoga techniques. Two RCTs investigated the efficacy of MBSR to prevent depressive symptoms88 and cope with severe vasomotor symptoms.89 In 104 euthymic women in menopause, MBSR effectively prevented the development of depressive symptoms while also promoting higher levels of resilience and lower levels of stress and anxiety relative to participants who were on the waiting list for treatment.88 These benefits were particularly evident in partici",

In an RCT of 172 euthymic women in perimenopause and early postmenopause,76 high-dose MHT (100 μg transdermal oestradiol with progesterone every 3 months) halved the risk of emergent depressive symptoms compared with placebo over 12 months (incidence 17·3% vs 32·3%), particularly in those with stressful life events in the 6 months before assessment.

Psychotherapy might be particularly helpful when symptoms are caused or exacerbated by exogenous stressors, including life events and role transitions common in midlife women. Selected antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors might confer additional benefits by treating both depression and vasomotor symptoms.92 The duration of antidepressant treatment for major depressive disorder during the menopause transition has not been studied and standard treatment duration guidelines are therefore advised. For people experiencing major depressive disorder as they approach the menopause transition, consideration should be given to continuing antidepressants due to the increased risk of recurrence.93 MHT is not an approved treatment for depressive symptoms or major depressive disorder by regulatory agencies in Europe or the USA due to insufficient evidence for efficacy. Trials of MHT as a treatment for major depressive disorder have had small sample sizes (combined n=222 on MHT and a placebo) and shown mixed results.94–97 Two RCTs (combined n=84) found that transdermal oestradiol was superior to a placebo in women with perimenopause and early postmenopause over 3 weeks94 and 12 weeks95 of administration.

For example, the UK National Health Service and Mayo Clinic websites list mood changes as symptoms of menopause, whereas Johns Hopkins University emphasises that the association between menopause and mental health is inconclusive. Our findings support enhanced awareness of groups and individuals at risk for poor mental health over the menopause transition and caution against automatically attributing depressed mood or other mental health symptoms or disorders to menopause. This assumption is potentially harmful, as it creates negative expectations that reinforce stereotypes about the menopause and ageing.

According to UN data, 90% of people hold gender biases against women.103 Outdated views about menopause might be both a cause and a consequence of gender bias. Promoting gender equity and safety across the lifespan is relevant, since early life adversity is a powerful predictor of midlife mental health.56 Midlife is often a period of low wellbeing for both men and women,104 and, therefore, a potential window of opportunity to prioritise mental health optimisation. Psychological interventions such as MBSR show promise for prevention,88 and CBT can reduce anxiety and depressed mood, together with vasomotor symptoms.82 Primary care providers and community health educators can contribute to improving care with helpful health messaging and evidence-based practices that empower women and promote mental health over the menopause transition.

    "[INTRODUCTION] NAMS POSITION STATEMENT The 2020 genitourinary syndrome of menopause position statement of The North American Menopause Society Abstract Objective: To update and expand the 2013 position statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) on the management of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), of which symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is a component. Methods: A Panel of acknowledged experts in the field of genitourinary health reviewed the literature to evaluate new evidence on vaginal hormone therapies as well as on other management options available or in development forGSM.A search of PubMed was conducted identifying medical literature on VVA and GSM published since the 2013 position statement on the role of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for VVA in postmenopausal women. The Panel revised and added recommendations on the basis of current evidence. The Panel’s conclusions and recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Results: Genitourinary syndrome of menopause affects approximately 27% to 84% of postmenopausal women and can significantly impair health, sexual function, and quality of life. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is likely underdiagnosed and undertreated. In most cases, symptoms can be effectively managed. A number of over- the-counter and government-approved prescription therapies available in the United States and Canada demonstrate effectiveness, depending on the severity of symptoms. These include vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, vaginal estrogens and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), systemic hormone therapy, and the estrogen agonist/antagonist ospemifene. Long-term studies on the endometrial safety of vaginal estrogen, vaginal DHEA, and ospemifene are lacking. There are insufficient placebo-controlled trials of energy-based therapies, including laser, to draw conclusions on efficacy and safety or to make treatment recommendations.",

There are insufficient placebo-controlled trials of energy-based therapies, including laser, to draw conclusions on efficacy and safety or to make treatment recommendations. Conclusions: Clinicians can resolve many distressing genitourinary symptoms and improve sexual health and the quality of life of postmenopausal women by educating women about, diagnosing, and appropriately managing GSM. Choice of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms, the effectiveness and safety of treatments for the individual patient, and patient preference. Nonhormone therapies available without a prescription provide sufficient relief for most women with mild symptoms. Low-dose vaginal estrogens, vaginal DHEA, systemic estrogen therapy, and ospemifene are effective treatments for moderate to severe GSM. When low-dose vaginal estrogen or DHEA or ospemifene is administered, a progestogen is not indicated; however, endometrial safety has not been studied in clinical trials beyond 1 year. There are insufficient data at present to confirm the safety of vaginal estrogen or DHEA or ospemifene in women with breast cancer; management of GSM should consider the woman’s needs and the recommendations of her oncologist.

    "[INTRODUCTION] dergoing routine examinations, GSM was identified in 84% of women 6 years after menopause.4 Principal symptoms included vaginal dryness, painful sex, burning, and dysuria. In contrast to vasomotor symptoms (VMS) that usually improve over time, GSM is generally progressive without effective therapy. Despite the high prev- alence of GSM and lack of improvement without treatment, only a minority of affected women seek help or are offered treatment by their healthcare providers.5,6 In a survey of 1,858 US postmenopausal women with genitourinary symptoms, 50% had never used any therapy for this problem.6 The reluctance of women as well as health- care providers to initiate discussion of genitourinary symp- toms and safety concerns about hormone therapies contribute to limited assessment and treatment of GSM.7,8 The genitourinary syndrome of menopause often has significant adverse effects on a woman’s sexual health and quality of life (QOL).9 Women who are not sexually active also experience bothersome symptoms of GSM, affecting activities of daily living.10 In the Vaginal Health: Insights, Views & Attitudes (VIVA) online survey of 3,520 postmenopausal women in six countries, 45% reported experiencing vaginal symptoms, and 75% felt that their symptoms negatively affected their lives.11 In 500 US women in the VIVA survey, of the 48% with vaginal discomfort, the most common symptoms were vaginal dryness and pain during intercourse.5 Women in VIVA in the United States reported these adverse events (AEs) of vaginal discomfort: \u0002 Negative effect on their lives (80%) \u0002 Adverse effects on sexual intimacy (75%) \u0002 Feeling less sexual (68%) \u0002 Feeling old (36%) \u0002 Negative consequences on marriage/relationship (33%) \u0002 Negative effect on self-esteem (26%) \u0002 Lower QOL (25%) In a survey of 3,046 US women, Real Women’s Views of Treatment Options for Menopausal Vaginal Changes (REVIVE),7 women reported that their vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) symptoms: \u0002 Led to some loss of intimacy (85%) \u0002",

A literature search was conducted using the terms ‘‘genitourinary syn- drome of menopause/GSM,’’ ‘‘vulvovaginal atrophy/VVA,’’ ‘‘atrophic vaginitis,’’ ‘‘dyspareunia,’’ ‘‘vaginal dryness,’’ and ‘‘vaginal lubrication.’’ If evidence was contradictory or inadequate to form a conclusion, a consensus-based opin- ion was established.

    "[INTRODUCTION] enopause describes the symp- toms and signs resulting from the effect of estrogen deficiency on the female genitourinary tract, including the vagina, labia, urethra, and bladder.12 This syndrome includes genital symp- toms of dryness, burning, and irritation; urinary symptoms and conditions of dysuria, urgency, and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs); and sexual symptoms of pain and dryness. Physical changes and signs are varied. Women may experi- ence some or all of the symptoms and signs, which must be bothersome for a diagnosis of the syndrome. Other causes of similar signs and symptoms must be ruled out, including vulvovaginal dermatoses, infection, or cancer. Vulvovaginal atrophy is a component of GSM.13 Although VVA was the commonly used term in the past to describe the genitourinary changes of menopause, it has limitations. Vul- vovaginal atrophy describes the appearance of the genital tissues but not the associated symptoms. It does not include urinary tract changes related to estrogen deficiency, and the term atrophy has negative associations for women. The term genitourinary syndrome of menopause was developed during a consensus conference of experts12 and subsequently was accepted as the preferred term by many medical societies, including The North American Menopause Society and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY The genital and lower urinary tract share a common embryologic origin in women, with the urethra, bladder trigone, vulvar vestibule, and the upper vagina all derived from the same estrogen receptor (ER)-rich primitive urogeni- tal sinus tissue.14 The vulva is also derived from the urogenital sinus, but the epithelium of the labia majora is of ectodermal origin.

The vagina is composed of an inner stratified squa- mous epithelium, a middle muscular layer, and an outer fibrous layer. In the presence of endogenous estrogen after puberty and before menopause, the lining of the vagina is characterized by a thickened, rugated surface that is well vascularized and lubricated in most women. Estrogen is a dominant regulator of vaginal and lower urinary tract physiology.

Estrogen therapy (ET) does not appear to affect the presence of ER-b.15,16 Estrogen receptor density is highest in the vagina, with decreasing density across the external genitalia to the skin. The density of the androgen receptor is the reverse. There are low levels in the vagina and higher levels in the external genitalia. Progesterone receptors are found in the vagina and the transitional epithelium of the vulvovaginal junction.17 Estrogen receptors have also been found on autonomic and sensory neurons in the vagina and vulva. Estrogen therapy has been reported to decrease the density of sensory nocicep- tor neurons in the vagina. This function may serve to decrease the discomfort associated with GSM.18 With respect to the lower urinary tract, estrogen and progesterone receptors have been identified in the urethra, bladder, and pelvic floor muscles.14 The changing physiology of the vaginal epithelium after menopause is not completely understood.",

On the basis of a cell-culture model that used vaginal-cervical epithelial cells, diminished estrogen levels and aging were found to be independent factors in decreasing vaginal-cervical paracellu- lar permeability, a change potentially related to vaginal dryness.19 With atrophy, wet-mount microscopy shows more than one white blood cell per epithelial cell and immature vaginal epithelial cells with relatively large nuclei (parabasal cells). Cytology shows an increase in parabasal and interme- diate cells, and superficial cells decrease or are absent.20 Immune cell populations seem to be similar or slightly decreased in number, with similar cytolytic capacity as before menopause.21-23 However, some studies show differences in inflammatory markers in the vaginal fluid of postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal women.24 Hormone changes throughout the life cycle influence the vaginal microbiome from birth through postmenopause.25,26 During the reproductive years, the presence of a microbial community dominated by Lactobacillus species is associated with a lower pH and lower risk for bacterial vaginosis (BV), sexually transmitted infections, UTIs, and HIV infection.27-35 After menopause, women are less likely to have a Lacto- bacillus-dominant vaginal bacterial community and less likely to have a low vaginal pH.26.36,37 Although cultiva- tion-based studies show a significantly lower quantity of vaginal Lactobacillus in postmenopausal women,37 several newer sequencing studies observe that close to half have a high proportion of lactobacilli.38,39 In one study, a higher proportion of Lactobacillus correlated inversely with exam- iner-reported dryness in postmenopausal w",

PRESENTATION The diagnosis of GSM requires the presence of both characteristic examination findings and bothersome symp- toms. The most commonly reported symptoms include irrita- tion of the vulva, inadequate vaginal lubrication, burning, dysuria, dyspareunia, and vaginal discharge. Symptoms adversely affecting sexual function are often the most dis- tressing.12,46,47 Signs of GSM include labial atrophy, vaginal dryness, introital stenosis, clitoral atrophy, and phimosis of the pre- puce. Severe GSM can result in a vaginal surface that is friable and hypopigmented, with petechiae, ulcerations, and tears, as well as urethral findings such as caruncles, prolapse, or polyps. Bleeding may occur from minimal trauma, such as speculum insertion.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] oral atrophy, and phimosis of the pre- puce. Severe GSM can result in a vaginal surface that is friable and hypopigmented, with petechiae, ulcerations, and tears, as well as urethral findings such as caruncles, prolapse, or polyps. Bleeding may occur from minimal trauma, such as speculum insertion. Genitourinary atrophic changes increase the likelihood of trauma, pain, recurrent UTIs, bleeding with or after sex, and absence of sexual activity.20,47 The genitourinary syndrome of menopause most commonly develops in the setting of hypoestrogenism associated with natural menopause. Hypoestrogenic states also may occur in the setting of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), surgical menopause (bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterec- tomy), hypothalamic amenorrhea, the postpartum state and breastfeeding, use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or aromatase inhibitors (AIs), and cancer treatments such as surgery, pelvic radiation therapy, or chemotherapy that render ovaries inactive, either temporarily or permanently. Several studies suggest that early estrogen deficiency caused by premature menopause or POI is associated with more severe sexual dysfunction compared with age-matched controls.48,49 Younger women with vaginal atrophy and dys- pareunia may be especially distressed by changes in sexual function. Women with surgical menopause often present with a more severe GSM symptom profile than do women with natural menopause, likely because of the concomitant, abrupt, and persistent 50% decline in circulating androgen levels that occurs in addition to the loss of estradiol.50,51 Genitourinary syndrome of menopause that develops in the setting of chemotherapy-induced menopause has been associated in some studies with greater sexual dysfunction and distress52- 54 and with poorer QOL outcomes.55-58 Younger women with GSM related to induced menopause from cancer treatment may be especially distressed by changes in sexual func- tion.52,55 The stress, fatigue, an",

The mag- nitude and duration of estrogen deficiency induced by AIs result in the development of severe GSM in most survi- vors, particularly given that extended duration therapy is now typical.59-61 Compared with tamoxifen, AIs result in a greater incidence of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, causing a large percentage of AI users to express dissat- isfaction with their sex lives.60,62-64 EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS The evaluation of GSM includes a history and pelvic examination. A medical history may identify contributing factors, alternative etiologies, and effective therapeutic inter- ventions. The pelvic examination should identify signs con- sistent with GSM and eliminate other pathologic conditions that may cause similar symptoms.

    "[INTRODUCTION] and eliminate other pathologic conditions that may cause similar symptoms. History Because women may not spontaneously report symp- toms of GSM and related sexual concerns, providers should inquire about symptoms in all perimenopausal and postmenopausal women as part of a routine review of systems. The EMPOWER survey queried 1,858 meno- pausal US women with symptoms suggestive of GSM and found that in women who had never used any treatment, almost three-quarters had never discussed their symptoms with a healthcare provider.6 The main reason for this reticence was the assumption that GSM was simply a natural part of aging with which women needed to live. Results of the Women’s Voices in the Menopause survey revealed that in more than 1,000 US respondents, one- third of those with vaginal discomfort had not spoken with anyone regarding their condition and one-third preferred that discussion regarding vaginal discomfort be initiated by their healthcare providers.65 These survey results underscore the importance of clini- cians being proactive in asking menopausal women whether symptoms suggestive of GSM are present. The goal of the history is to determine whether symptoms of GSM are present, whether they are bothersome, and how they affect the woman’s sexual health and QOL. In the absence of symptoms, atrophic changes noted on examination do not necessarily require treatment, although women should be informed that these changes may worsen over time without proactive management. Symptoms similar to GSM result from many other con- ditions. The differential diagnosis includes allergic or inflammatory conditions (eg, lichen sclerosus, erosive lichen planus, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, con- tact dermatitis, and cicatricial pemphigoid), vulvovaginal candidiasis and other infections, trauma, foreign bodies, malignancy, vulvodynia, vestibulodynia, chronic pelvic pain, provoked pelvic floor hypertonia (previously known as vaginismus), and other medical conditions (eg,",

An alter- nate etiology is more likely in women with chronic or recurrent vulvovaginal symptoms that were present before menopause. Documentation of GSM should include a description of symptoms, including time of onset, duration, level of associ- ated distress, and effect on QOL. A sexual history that includes partner relationship(s), current level and types of sexual activity, and the effect of GSM symptoms on sex life and partner relationships is useful in determining manage- ment strategies. Previous interventions should be discussed, including their efficacy and adverse effects. For a woman with a history of cancer, additional informa- tion is relevant, including cancer site, age at diagnosis, hormone receptor status, treatments (past, current), and type of menopause (spontaneous or induced). Cancer treatments, especially surgery and radiation therapy, can damage the vaginal epithelium, the vascular supply, and the anatomy of the vaginal canal. Some treated women experience a narrowed or foreshortened vagina. Genitourinary changes associated with cancer treatments can produce pain with pelvic examinations, dyspareunia, recurrent UTIs, and an increased risk of vaginal infections.52,66 Physical examination The pelvic examination helps to exclude other vulvova- ginal conditions that can cause similar symptoms. As GSM progresses, examination of the external genitalia often reveals reduced mons pubis and labia majora bulk, reduced labia minora tissue and pigmentation, and prominence (telescoping) and erythema of the urethral meatus.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] o exclude other vulvova- ginal conditions that can cause similar symptoms. As GSM progresses, examination of the external genitalia often reveals reduced mons pubis and labia majora bulk, reduced labia minora tissue and pigmentation, and prominence (telescoping) and erythema of the urethral meatus. Urethral caruncle, a benign outgrowth of inflammatory tissue arising from the posterior urethral meatus, is common in postmen- opausal women and likely related to hypoestrogenism. The clitoris may recede and in some cases become completely flush with the surrounding tissue. The vestibular tissue may become pale. If the introitus is noted to be narrow, use of a narrow pediatric vaginal speculum with lubricant is appropriate. The vaginal mucosa may appear smooth (loss of rugation), shiny, and dry. Minimal blunt trauma from the speculum may result in petechiae (reflecting mucosal thinning) or bleeding (fria- bility). With progression of GSM, attenuation of the vaginal fornices may be apparent, and the cervix may appear flush with the vaginal apex. With atrophic vaginitis, brown or yellow (sometimes mal- odorous) discharge may be present. With severe GSM, there may be such shortening of the vaginal vault and narrowing of the introitus that speculum insertion and visual inspection of the vaginal vault as well as cervix may not be possible. Although the vaginal maturation index (VMI) and vaginal pH are routinely assessed in clinical trials, they are not essential to make a diagnosis of GSM in clinical practice. With GSM, vaginal pH is typically greater than 5.0.

A woman’s symptoms do not always correlate with physi- cal findings. For example, a woman who is not sexually active may have few symptoms, despite signs of advanced genito- urinary atrophy on examination. In contrast, a woman with an active sex life may complain of dryness and discomfort with sex, whereas the pelvic examination suggests only mild atrophy. Of note, women who are not sexually active also may be bothered by symptoms related to GSM, including discomfort with exercise or dysuria and benefit from treat- ment. Thus, both history and examination are essential to making a correct diagnosis. TREATMENT The primary goal of treating GSM is to alleviate symptoms. For the woman with GSM, after excluding other causes of her symptoms, treatment can be approached in a stepwise fashion based on symptom severity. First-line therapies for less- severe symptoms include nonhormone vulvar and vaginal lubricants with sexual activity and long-acting vaginal mois- turizers used regularly (several times/wk). Although not supported by clinical trials, regular, gentle vaginal stretching exercises (eg, pain-free insertion of a finger or dilator) or sexual activity may reduce GSM symptoms.

Although not supported by clinical trials, regular, gentle vaginal stretching exercises (eg, pain-free insertion of a finger or dilator) or sexual activity may reduce GSM symptoms. Prescription therapies include low-dose vaginal estrogens, vaginal DHEA inserts, and oral ospemifene. For women with moderate to severe dyspareunia associated with GSM with concurrent VMS, transdermal and oral HT are effective options. Symp- tom reduction may take 1 to 3 months, and continued therapy is generally required because symptoms are likely to recur on cessation of treatment. Outcomes data on the symptom recur- rence rate are lacking. Some women may already have vaginal narrowing or provoked pelvic floor hypertonia limiting vaginal penetration. Gentle stretching of the vagina with the use of lubricated vaginal dilators of graduated sizes (or an expandable dilator) can play an important role in restoring and maintaining vaginal function for penetration. Reinitiating regular sexual activity once vaginal penetration is again comfortable, if desired, may help to maintain vaginal pliability. Many women with this condition benefit from referral for pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT).69,70 Starting pharmacologic treat- ment to restore tissue integrity before initiating vaginal dilatation and/or PFPT may facilitate progress. Nonprescription therapies Lubricants and moisturizers First-line therapies to alleviate symptoms of GSM include over-the-counter (OTC) nonhormone vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, a number of which are available ( few clinical studies have been conducted on the efficacy of these products.

A vaginal moisturizer is a bioadhesive product used regu- larly, most often two to three times a week, irrespective of the timing of sexual activity. The goal of use is to reduce daily symptoms of GSM as well as to facilitate comfortable sexual activity. Data suggesting improvement in genitourinary symptoms with nonhormone treatments are sparse, and to date, there are no adequately powered, randomized, double- blind, placebo controlled studies directly comparing low-dose vaginal estrogen therapies or vaginal DHEA with commonly used nonhormone treatments. One randomized, controlled, but short-term study demonstrated effectiveness of a pH- balanced gel compared with placebo in women treated for breast cancer. Mild irritation with administration was noted.71 In a randomized, controlled trial (RCT; N ¼ 302), a signifi- cant improvement in most bothersome symptom severity was seen in all three arms: the vaginal estradiol tablet (plus placebo gel), vaginal moisturizer (plus placebo tablet), and dual placebo arms.72 In that trial, the placebo gel likely had lubricating properties. Vaginal lubricants are used by both (or all) partners to decrease discomfort caused by friction during sex. Regular use has also been associated with increase in pleasure and ease of orgasm.73 In a review and meta-analysis, the effect of lubricant use on symptom severity could not be compared in studies because of heterogeneity. However, the meta-analysis of sexual function outcomes showed a small advantage to hormone-based therapies over lubricants in restoring sexual function.74 One small crossover study in survivors of breast cancer demonstrated greater benefit with silicone-based lubri- cants compared with water based.75 dyspareunia secondary to GSM Lubricants Moisturizers Water based Astroglide Liquid Replens Astroglide Gel Liquid Me Again Astroglide Feminease Good Clean Love K-Y SILK-E Just Like Me Luvena K-Y Jelly Revaree Pre-Seed Silken Secret",

Near iso-osmolar and silicone-based lubricants did not have this effect. The World Health Organization recommends an osmo- larity of less than 1,200 mOsm/kg.78 One jelly and one moisturizer also were found to be toxic to lactobacilli. There are very few data on the health and safety effects of lubricants that contain flavors (sugar), warming properties, or solvents and preservatives such as propylene glycol and parabens. One study on the use of vaginal products in women aged 18 to 65 years reported a 2.2-fold risk of BV in women using petroleum jelly compared with controls and increased colo- nization with candida species with users of oils compared with nonusers.79 Because there are no published reports on the irritation potential of OTC vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, women can test these on a small patch of skin for 24 hours before using them intravaginally.",

If the product they test successfully on the skin still causes irritation in the vagina, a woman can switch to an iso-osmolar, propylene glycol-free, or silicone- based product (lubricants can erode condoms; however, most brands of water-based and silicone-based lubricants are latex safe and condom compatible. Hyaluronic acid Hyaluronic acid is a polymer found in cartilage and other soft tissues in the body that is added to many commercial skin- care and wound-healing products because of its purported effect of drawing moisture to any area to which it is applied. In four small RCTs comparing hyaluronic acid to placebo or vaginal ET, the former was associated with a similar decrease in severity of dryness and dyspareunia.80-83 To date, there is no evidence that products with hyaluronic acid have a greater benefit than nonhyaluronic acid lubricants or moisturizers. Herbal products Herbal products appear ineffective for GSM. The Herbal Alternatives for Menopause study, a double-blind RCT in 351 women, identified no change in vaginal dryness, vaginal cytology, follicle-stimulating hormone or estradiol levels following treatment for 1 year with black cohosh, a multi- botanical supplement, or soy.84 Prescription therapies For women with persistent GSM symptoms after nonhor- mone interventions, prescription therapies may provide greater benefit.

Efficacy studies of low-dose vaginal ET use both subjective and objective outcome measures. Subjective effects are often assessed using patient-reported outcome measures that include improvements in symptoms such as dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and lower urinary tract symptoms and clini- cian-reported outcomes such as the appearance of the vulvo- vaginal tissues. Objective outcomes include decreases in vaginal pH, increases in the number of vaginal lactobacilli, and favorable shifts in the vaginal and/or urethral cytology (greater numbers and percentages of superficial cells and fewer numbers and percentages of parabasal cells).87,88 Efficacy Low-dose vaginal ET is available in several forms, includ- ing cream (estradiol, estrone, and conjugated estrogens), a slow-release estradiol intravaginal ring, and an estradiol vaginal tablet and insert. Products vary in dosage and formu- lation (efficacy in placebo-controlled RCTs.86,98-111 In the United States, FDA requires efficacy data for treatment of a specific, most bothersome symptom, which includes dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, vaginal/vulvar irritation, vaginal soreness, dysuria, or bleeding associated with sexual activity.

The comparative efficacy of the various forms of vaginal ET was evaluated in a 2016 Cochrane review comparing 19 trials.112 This review concluded that all tested products alleviated symptoms of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia with similar efficacy. Comparative analyses of these trials are limited by variations in methods and outcome measures, small sample sizes, lack of blinding, and substantial hetero- geneity of results. Some trials of the same estrogen prepara- tion used different doses or dosing schedules. Some trials included preparations not approved for use in the United States or in Canada. Vaginal estrogen and urinary symptoms In a 2014 systematic review that included 44 RCTs, assessment of urinary symptoms was variable, leading to a lower quality of evidence for the effectiveness of vaginal estrogen for urinary symptoms compared with vulvovaginal symptoms.113 This review reported moderate-quality evi- dence supporting vaginal ET in the treatment of urge inconti- nence and recurrent UTIs and low or very-low quality evidence supporting the use of vaginal ET for improvement of dysuria, urinary frequency and urgency, nocturia, and stress incontinence. A Cochrane review of vaginal ET for urinary incontinence determined that vaginal ET improves incontinence (relative risk [RR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.86) but NAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, Vol. 27, No. 9, 2020 981 Copyright @ 2020 The North American Menopause Society.

    "[INTRODUCTION] (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.17-1.48 and RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18, respectively).114 Most of these studies were conducted for reasons other than urinary symptoms, failed to use validated tools to assess symptom severity and QOL, and showed statistically signifi- cant but not clinically relevant changes. For example, in the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study, women randomized to systemic oral estrogen plus progestogen ther- apy experienced 0.7 more leak episodes per week compared with 0.1 fewer episodes in the placebo group, but both changes met the a priori definition of ‘‘no change in inconti- nence severity.’’115 Few trials have been conducted comparing vaginal ET to other treatments for postmenopausal urinary tract symptoms. Two small trials comparing vaginal ET (conjugated equine estrogens) to pelvic floor muscle therapy (PFMT) for urinary incontinence favored PFMT over vaginal estrogen,114 but a trial that compared estriol alone to estriol combined with pelvic floor rehabilitation favored combined therapy.69 A comparison of the estradiol ring to oral oxybutynin showed similar efficacy for treatment of overactive bladder but with different AEs; oxybutynin resulted in more dry mouth, con- stipation, and blurry vision, whereas the estradiol ring resulted in more vaginal discharge.116 When women present with both vulvovaginal and urinary symptoms, an initial trial of vaginal ET is prudent. If urinary symptoms are not sufficiently improved or resolved after 3 months of vaginal ET, the use of other evidence-based therapies for urinary tract symptoms is warranted.117 Recurrent UTI, defined as the occurrence of two culture- proven UTIs in 6 months or three culture-proven UTIs in 1 year, commonly affects postmenopausal women and is a component of GSM.118 Treatment of GSM with vaginal ET (conjugated equine estrogen cream or low-dose estradiol vaginal ring) in a small RCT reduced the frequency of recurrent UTIs in postmenopausal women.119 An RCT of vaginal estriol",

Prospec- tive data are lacking, but observational studies show lower discontinuation rates and less vaginal discharge when pessary users are treated with vaginal ET.122 Safety Low-dose vaginal ET has a more favorable risk profile than systemic ET because estrogen doses are significantly lower (vagina in a dose-dependent manner, and in general, serum estrogen levels reported with use of low-dose vaginal ET remain within the postmenopause range.123 A review of systemic estradiol measurements reported baseline levels in normal, untreated postmenopausal women of 3.1 pg/mL to 4.9 pg/mL using highly sensitive assays such as liquid or gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy and levels that were undetectable to 10.5 pg/mL using the less-sensitive radioim- munoassay.85 Serum estradiol levels with use of the low-dose vaginal ring (releasing approximately 7.5 mg/d) ranged from 5 pg/mL to 10 pg/mL.107,124,125 Serum estradiol levels with use of the 10-mg vaginal tablet ranged from 3 pg/mL Type Composition Product name Commonly used starting dose Commonly used maintenance dose Typical serum estra- diol leve",

After twice weekly use for 84 days, there was no difference in serum estradiol levels compared with baseline or placebo. Serum estradiol levels associated with use of vaginal estradiol cream are derived from older data using higher doses and less-sensitive assays that lack accuracy for lower estrogen levels.129 Use of estradiol cream 0.5 mg (500 mg) daily for 3 weeks resulted in no change in serum estradiol levels.130 In contrast, another study showed that daily use of estradiol cream 0.2 mg (200 mg) daily resulted in serum estradiol levels that rose from a baseline of 16.6 pg/mL to 37.2 pg/mL after 3 weeks of use.131 Use of 0.3 mg conjugated estrogens (CE) cream 3 times weekly for 6 months produced no change in serum estradiol or estrone levels.132 Of note, CE contains a significant number of compounds, some estrogenic and some antiestrogenic, so serum estradiol and estrone levels after use of CE may not reflect actual estrogenic activity. Vaginal bleeding, breast pain, and nausea have been reported in some trials of vaginal estrogen cream. These symptoms are dose related and suggest that the dose was large enough to result in significant systemic absorption.

Clinical trial data beyond 1 year are lacking, however, because the longest duration of any RCT was 52 weeks.135 Endometrial safety was assessed in two systematic reviews that included RCTs and large observational studies.136,137 In 20 RCTs, 2,983 women were exposed to vaginal ET for up to 1 year. There was one case of endometrial cancer (0.03%) and 12 cases of endometrial hyperplasia (0.4%). The cases were sporadic and their incidence similar to the baseline rate in the general population. A 2016 Cochrane review of RCTs reported no significant differences among vaginal estrogen formulations in terms of endometrial thickness or hyperplasia or the proportion of women with AEs.112 Large observational studies evaluating longer exposures to vaginal ET identified no increase in endometrial cancer. In the Women’s Health Initiative-Observational Study, the rate of endometrial cancer was not statistically different in users of vaginal ET compared with nonusers (1.3 vs 1 case per 1,000 woman-years, respec- tively). Thus, occurrence of endometrial cancer and hyper- plasia with low-dose vaginal ET use is rare and consistent with rates in the general population. The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) was not increased with vaginal ET use in a 2016 Cochrane review, a 2020 systematic review of RCTs, and three large observa- tional studies.112,135,137-139 Of note, systematic, prospective data for women at high risk of VTE are lacking.

A prospective cohort study of approximately 45,000 women in the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study examined risks associated with vaginal ET use. Outcomes assessed included coronary heart disease (CHD), invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism, hip fracture, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and death. The findings were very reassuring, with no increased risk of CVD or cancer in postmenopausal women using vaginal estrogens.135 Another prospective cohort study of approximately 54,000 postmenopausal women in the Nurses’ Health Study also was very reassuring regarding the safety of vaginal ET. There was no increase in health outcomes assessed with vaginal ET use, including CVD (total myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmo- nary embolism/VTE), hip fracture, and cancer (total invasive, breast, endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal).138 In a 2019 meta-analysis, investigators used individual participant data from 58 observational studies reported between 1992 and 2018 to assess associations between hormone therapy and breast cancer.140 Use of vaginal estrogen was not found to be associated with risk of breast cancer. Potential contraindications to vaginal estrogen therapy Although most women with GSM are candidates for low- dose vaginal ET, use is contraindicated in women with undiagnosed vaginal/uterine bleeding and should be used with caution in women with estrogen-dependent neoplasia. Management of GSM in women with nonhormone-dependent cancers is similar to that for women without a cancer history. Low-dose vaginal ET has not been studied in women at increased risk of thrombosis, but may be used with caution given minimal systemic absorption, the absence of a hepatic first-pass effect, and minimal, if any, effect on prothrombotic factors.",

Low-dose vaginal ET has not been studied in women at increased risk of thrombosis, but may be used with caution given minimal systemic absorption, the absence of a hepatic first-pass effect, and minimal, if any, effect on prothrombotic factors. Of note, in large observational studies, neither vaginal estrogen nor systemic transdermal formulations of ET have been associated with an increased risk of VTE.139 Although circulating estrogen concentrations generally remain within the menopause range with low-dose vaginal ET, the package insert for these products includes the same boxed warning regarding risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and probable dementia that accompanies systemic HT products. Women must be edu- cated about the differences between low-dose vaginal and systemic ET and be prepared for the boxed warning, or else they may not initiate prescribed treatment. Vaginal estrogen products Several low-dose vaginal estrogen products have been gov- ernment approved for use in the United States and Canada, including cream (estradiol, estrone, and conjugated estrogens), a slow-release estradiol intravaginal ring, and an estradiol vaginal tablet and insert (creams are generally used two to three times weekly, estradiol tablets and inserts used twice weekly, and the estradiol ring changed every 3 months.

Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. product (Femring) delivers a systemic dose of estradiol and is approved for the treatment of VMS in addition to GSM.141 Femring should not be confused with Estring, which delivers a low dose of estradiol and is indicated only for GSM. There are no data to suggest an advantage for initial use of combined systemic and vaginal estrogen in cases of severe GSM. Therapy with low-dose vaginal estrogen can be individu- alized to identify the lowest dose and frequency of use that provides the desired effect. Although efficacy is similar among the available products, estrogen creams dispensed with an applicator may offer more immediate soothing relief of symptoms, possibly because of the emollient nature of the carrier. Another potential advantage of the creams is that they can be digitally applied directly to the vulvar and vestibular tissues. However, some women consider the creams messy, and some report sensitivity to the vehicle used in the creams. With estrogen cream delivery, the user has the responsibility of preparing the dose because the amount of cream inserted is not in a prepackaged dosing unit—potentially leading to use of higher-than-recommended doses. The clinical implica- tions of potential male partner estrogen absorption remain unknown. Low-dose estradiol tablets and inserts are convenient, fixed-dose vaginal estrogen formulations. Although two doses of the vaginal tablet (25 mg and 10 mg) were shown to be effective, only the lower dose (10 mg) is available in the United States and Canada.101,102,107-109,111,142 There are two approved doses of the vaginal insert (4 mg and 10 mg), with the 4-mg dose providing the lowest available formulation of vaginal ET.143-145 The sustained-release, low-dose estradiol vaginal ring pro- vides 90 days of continuous estradiol.",

Effective relief of genitourinary symptoms, including dyspareunia, dysuria, and urge incontinence, has been consistently documented in RCTs with this estrogen delivery system.99,100,103-107 The estradiol ring may change position or dislodge with bowel movements, Valsalva maneuvers, douching, or vaginal sexual penetration, particularly in women with uterovaginal prolapse or hysterectomy. Vaginal ring users are encouraged to remove and replace their own vaginal rings unless discom- fort or limited dexterity makes such self-care difficult. The ring can remain in the vagina during sexual activity. There are no data to suggest an allergic reaction to the silicone product. If there is significant stenosis of the vagina, regular use of graduated vaginal dilators after initiation of estrogen cream, tablet, or insert may be necessary before an estrogen ring can be inserted. Given similar efficacy among vaginal estrogen formula- tions, women should be provided with information on all options, with personal preference guiding choice. Although some women prefer estrogen creams to allow for vulvar and vestibular as well as vaginal application, others find creams messy and dislike cleaning the applicator after use. Because creams do not provide a specific, fixed dose of estrogen, other options may be preferred if careful dosing and predictable results of serum estrogen levels are desired.

The tablet is placed in the vagina with a plastic applicator, whereas the insert is placed with a finger. Preference for insertion method may determine product choice. For women who are comfort- able using a vaginal ring, this formulation is convenient, requiring placing a new ring only four times yearly. Vaginal estrogen formulations are often costly, and variation in price, depending on a woman’s particular insurance coverage, also may be a factor in product choice. Vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone Dehydroepiandrosterone (also known as prasterone) is a steroid hormone that is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of androgens and estrogens. A low-dose DHEA vaginal insert used daily with an applicator is approved in the United States and Canada for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspar- eunia in menopausal women (drosterone is transformed by vaginal mucosal cells to estrogens, including estradiol, and to androgens, including testosterone.146 Twelve-week RCTs have demonstrated the efficacy of DHEA 6.5 mg daily in improving the VMI, vaginal pH, dyspareunia, and vaginal dryness in menopausal women with GSM. Vaginal discharge was the most common AE, reported by 6% of study participants. In 422 women receiving DHEA for 52 weeks, endometrial sampling demonstrated inactive or atrophic endometrium in all participants.147 Ospemifene Ospemifene is an estrogen agonist/antagonist and the only orally available product approved for treatment of vaginal dryness and moderate to severe dyspareunia. It is available in the United States, but not in Canada.97,148 Twelve-week RCTs have demonstrated the efficacy of ospemifene 60 mg daily in improving VMI, vaginal pH, dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and genital exam findings.149-151 A 52-week efficacy and safety extension study in 180 women showed sustained improvements on visual examination of the vagina, wi",

Ospemifene was shown to reduce recurrent UTIs in a 6-month retrospective observational study.153 The prescribing information for ospemifene contains pre- cautions similar to those for estrogens and other estrogen agonist/antagonists, including an increased risk of endome- trial cancer and CVD.97 With regard to breast cancer, labeling states that ospemifene should not be used in women with known or suspected breast cancer because the drug has not been adequately studied in this group. Ospemifene has, however, demonstrated antiestrogenic activity in preclinical models of breast cancer.154 In ex vivo human breast tissue, ospemifene inhibited proliferation and opposed stimulation caused by estradiol similar to but not as potently as the estrogen agonist/antagonists tamoxifen and raloxifene.155 Ospemifene 60 mg has been associated with decreased risk NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 984 Menopause, Vol. 27, No. 9, 2020 \u0002 2020 The North American Menopause Society Copyright @ 2020 The North American Menopause Society.

In the absence of contraindications, therapy should be continued as long as needed for symptom management as symptoms will recur upon discontinuation. Clinical trial safety data are limited to 1 year, but observational studies demonstrate safety with long-term use. Based on available limited safety data, use of a progesto- gen112,126 and routine endometrial surveillance112,158,159 are not recommended in low-risk women using low-dose vaginal ET. Women at increased risk of endometrial cancer because of obesity or diabetes may warrant endometrial surveillance. Because uterine bleeding is generally a sign of endometrial proliferation, any spotting or bleeding requires a thorough evaluation that may include transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) and/or endometrial biopsy. Testosterone Topical testosterone cream has been used for the treatment of vulvovaginal conditions, including lichen sclerosus and vestibulodynia, despite limited efficacy data.160,161 Although not government approved for this indication, there are limited data supporting the use of vaginal testosterone cream for the treatment for GSM. A 4-week pilot trial of 20 postmenopausal women with breast cancer found that vaginal testosterone (150 mg and 300 mg) improved dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and VMI without increasing estradiol; median testosterone level increased from 15.5 ng/dL to 21.5 ng/dL (P ¼ .02).162 A 12-week RCT in 76 menopausal women taking AIs after treatment for early stage breast cancer who reported vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, or reduced libido compared the low- dose estradiol vaginal ring with compounded vaginal testos- terone cream.

    "[INTRODUCTION] in 76 menopausal women taking AIs after treatment for early stage breast cancer who reported vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, or reduced libido compared the low- dose estradiol vaginal ring with compounded vaginal testos- terone cream. Symptoms of GSM and sexual desire improved in both treatment arms. The observation that levels of serum estradiol were increased in trial participants at baseline com- plicates interpretation of these findings.163 Existing clinical trial data are insufficient to recommend the use of vaginal testosterone for GSM.164 Longer and larger studies are needed to assess safety and efficacy. Energy-based therapies Vulvovaginal energy-based devices including lasers (fractional CO2, Erbium:YAG) and radio-frequency devices are under investigation as treatments for GSM, but none have FDA approval for this indication. In a 2018 Safety Communication, FDA issued a public warning about the use of these devices for vaginal cosmetic purposes, stating that the effectiveness and safety of the devices have not yet been established.165 Vulvovaginal energy-based devices are thought to improve vaginalhealthbycausingmicrotrauma, which induces collagen formation, angiogenesis, and epithelial thickening. The frac- tional CO2 laser has demonstrated safety and efficacy in tissues of the skin, face, and neck.166-169 Using a probe adapted to the vagina, fractional CO2 vaginal laser therapy induces similar morphologic changes in the vagina, and data from small studies support improvement in GSM symptoms of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia.170-178 Several RCTs have compared laser therapy to vaginal ET. Overall, no treatment was superior to another, and the studies were not designed to assess noninfer- iority.179-182 Radiofrequency devices are nonablative and emit focused electromagnetic waves that heat the superficial layers of the tissue.

Several RCTs evaluating the efficacy of energy- based devices in the treatment of GSM are in progress. Safety Adverse events associated with energy-based therapies include discomfort during treatments, vaginal scarring, vagi- nal lacerations on resumption of intercourse, and persistent and/or worsening dyspareunia.183 These treatments are costly and generally not covered by insurers. Consensus statements regarding the use of energy-based therapies for GSM treatment have been published by several professional societies summarizing the small but growing body of evidence as well as concerns about safety.184-187 Additional randomized, prospective, sham-controlled trials of adequate size and scope are necessary before these therapies can be routinely recommended for treatment of GSM. Treatment considerations in women with breast cancer Treatment of GSM in women with breast cancer can be complicated by 1) adjuvant treatment (AIs or tamoxifen), which lower estrogen concentrations or antagonize estrogen effects; 2) product labeling; 3) limited clinical trial data in patients with breast cancer or survivors; and 4) absence of agreement between the oncology community and other prac- titioners involved in genitourinary and sexual healthcare. Many women with breast cancer and GSM will benefit from the regular use of vaginal moisturizers, lubricants for sexual activity, and PFPT. For persistent symptoms, other therapies may be beneficial, including topical lidocaine, low-dose vaginal ET, vaginal DHEA, ospemifene, and vaginal energy-based therapies.188-191 For women with breast cancer, low-dose vaginal ET is contraindicated according to FDA class labeling.",

For persistent symptoms, other therapies may be beneficial, including topical lidocaine, low-dose vaginal ET, vaginal DHEA, ospemifene, and vaginal energy-based therapies.188-191 For women with breast cancer, low-dose vaginal ET is contraindicated according to FDA class labeling. However, off-label use of several products may be acceptable because of their very low systemic absorption.192 Low-dose vaginal ET formulations, including the estradiol tablet, insert, and ring, result in serum estradiol within the postmenopausal range and similar to placebo.145,146 Several organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have endorsed the use of low-dose vaginal estrogens in women with breast cancer, including ER-positive disease. A system- atic review and meta-analysis also suggests safety, based on the use of low-dose vaginal ET in survivors of breast cancer using concomitant AIs.193 Many oncologists allow the use of low-dose vaginal ET or vaginal DHEA in their patients with NAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, Vol. 27, No. 9, 2020 985 breast cancer when GSM symptoms persist after trials of nonhormone interventions and QOL is adversely affected. Use of vaginal DHEA for GSM in women with breast cancer is not contraindicated, but US labeling advises caution because estrogen is a metabolite of DHEA.95 Although vagi- nal DHEA has not been studied in women with a history of breast cancer, levels of estradiol and testosterone remain within the postmenopause range.194 Ospemifene is not recommended for treatment of GSM in women with known or suspected breast cancer because the drug has not been adequately studied in this group. Prelimi- nary data on ospemifene suggest both a decreased risk of incident breast cancer and a reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence with this therapy.156 Clinical trials of laser therapy for GSM in survivors of breast cancer provide limited evidence for safety and efficacy in this patient population.19",

Education Healthcare providers should educate women about GSM and the urogenital changes that often occur with menopause. Many women are unaware that vaginal dryness, recurrent UTIs, discomfort with sexual activity, and other GSM symptoms are a consequence of estrogen deficiency. Unlike VMS that typically improve with time, GSM symptoms often worsen in the absence of treatment. Women also may not know that effective and safe OTC and prescription therapies are available. Women who are sexually active are more likely to notice GSM symptoms and seek care, but sexually inactive women also will benefit from education about GSM. Women who are concerned about future uro- genital function may consider preventive use of lubricants, moisturizers, vaginal dilators, or prescription therapies, but there is no evidence to support this approach. It is unknown whether treatment to preserve sexual function or prevent the future occurrence of GSM is indicated in the absence of urogenital symptoms.

    "[INTRODUCTION] NAMS POSITION STATEMENT The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of The North American Menopause Society Abstract “The 2022 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society” (NAMS) updates “The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society” and identifies future re- search needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women’s health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2017 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach con- sensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Advisory Panel’s recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syn- drome of menopause and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of hormone therapy differ depend- ing on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treat- ment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing therapy. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindica- tions, the benefit-risk ratio is favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and prevention of bone loss. For women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopause onset or who are aged older than 60 years, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS, with shared decision-making and periodic reevaluation.",

Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS, with shared decision-making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome genitourinary syndrome of menopause symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies in women without indications for use of systemic hormone ther- apy, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies (eg, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone or oral ospemifene) are recommended.

METHODS An Advisory Panel of clinicians and research experts in the field of women’s health and menopause were enlisted to review “The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society,” evaluate the literature published subsequently, and conduct an evidence-based analysis, with the goal of reaching consensus recommendations. NAMS acknowledges that no single trial’s findings can be extrapolated to all women. The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) is the largest, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of hormone ther- apy in women aged 50 to 79 years, and its findings were therefore given prominent consideration. However, it is important to note that the WHI employed just one route of administration (oral), one formulation of estrogen (conjugated equine estrogens [CEE] 0.625 mg), and only one progestogen (medroxyprogesterone ace- tate [MPA] 2.5 mg), with limited enrollment of women with both- ersome vasomotor symptoms (VMS; hot flashes, night sweats) who were aged younger than 60 years or who were fewer than 10 years from menopause onset—the group of women for whom hormone therapy is currently primarily indicated. In addition, the WHI trials did not include women with early or premature meno- pause. In achieving consensus, the panel took into consideration the level of evidence (RCTs>longitudinal studies>cross-sectional studies), sample sizes, risk of bias, data from meta-analyses and systematic reviews, and expert opinion from guidelines from other major medical societies, when appropriate.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] . In achieving consensus, the panel took into consideration the level of evidence (RCTs>longitudinal studies>cross-sectional studies), sample sizes, risk of bias, data from meta-analyses and systematic reviews, and expert opinion from guidelines from other major medical societies, when appropriate. “The 2022 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society” was written after this ex- tensive review of the pertinent literature and includes key points identified during the review process. The resulting manuscript was submitted to and reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. When recommendations are provided, they are graded ac- cording to these categories: • Level I: Based on good and consistent scientific evidence. • Level II: Based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence. • Level III: Based primarily on consensus and expert opinion. EXPLAINING HORMONE THERAPY RISK Healthcare professionals caring for menopausalwomen should understand the basic concepts of relative risk and absolute risk to communicate the potential benefits and risks of hormone therapy and other therapies. Relative risk (risk ratio) is the ratio of event rates in two groups, whereas absolute risk (risk differ- ence) is the absolute difference in the event rates between two groups.1 Absolute risks are more useful to convey risks and ben- efits in the clinical setting. Findings on hormone therapy from RCTs are generally con- sidered to provide stronger evidence, and those from observa- tional studies should be interpreted with greater caution, given the potential for confounding. Very small effect sizes may have more limited clinical or public health importance, especially if outcomes are rare ( Key points • Findings from RCTs of hormone therapy can be interpreted with greater confidence than observational studies. (Level I) • Smaller effect sizes may be less clinically relevant, particu- larly for rare outcomes.",

(Level I) • Smaller effect sizes may be less clinically relevant, particu- larly for rare outcomes. (Level I) FORMULATION, DOSING, ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION, AND SAFETY Formulation Estrogens Available estrogen preparations include CEE, synthetic con- jugated estrogens (CE), micronized 17β-estradiol, and ethinyl estradiol. Conjugated equine estrogens, used in the WHI trials, contain a mixture of CE purified from the urine of pregnant mares, including estrone sulfate. In postmenopausal women, es- trone sulfate is a naturally occurring estrogen that serves as a precursor and intermediate for the formation of estrone (a weak estrogen) and estradiol (a more potent estrogen and the predom- inant estrogen in premenopausal and perimenopausal women). Synthetic CE is a blend of synthetic estrogen substances includ- ing estrone sulfate, equilin sulfate, and estradiol sulfate. Pre- scription formulations of micronized 17β-estradiol are identical to the structure of estradiol that is produced by the ovaries. Es- tradiol is reversibly converted to estrone. Ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic estrogen primarily used in combination with a proges- tin in hormone contraceptives. Progestogens administered with estrogen Progestogens (general category that includes synthetic progestins and progesterone) commonly coadministered with estrogen in women with a uterus include MPA, norethindrone acetate (NETA), and micronized progesterone (MP). Medroxyprogesterone ace- tate, levonorgestrel, and NETA are synthetic progestins, whereas MP is structurally identical to the progesterone produced by the corpus luteum.",

Medroxyprogesterone ace- tate, levonorgestrel, and NETA are synthetic progestins, whereas MP is structurally identical to the progesterone produced by the corpus luteum. Progestogen indication: need for endometrial protection Chronic unopposed endometrial exposure to estrogen in- creases the risk for endometrial hyperplasia or cancer.3,4 The menopause-related indication for progestogen use is to prevent endometrial overgrowth and the increased risk of endometrial cancer during estrogen therapy (ET) use. Women with an intact uterus using systemic ET should receive adequate progestogen, unless they are taking CEE combined with bazedoxifene (BZA).5-7 Very common ≥1/10 Common (frequent) ≥1/100 and < 1/10 Uncommon (infrequent) ≥1/1,000 and < 1/100 Rare ≥1/10,000 and < 1/1,000 (≤10/10,000/y) Very rare <1/10,000 Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS).2 NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 768 Menopause, Vol. 29, No. 7, 2022 © 2022 The North American Menopause Society Progestogen dose and duration of use are important to ensur- ing endometrial protection. When adequate progestogen is com- bined with systemic estrogen, the risk of endometrial neoplasia is not higher than in untreated women. In the WHI, use of con- tinuous oral CEE plus MPA daily was associated with a risk of endometrial cancer similar to placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-1.36),8 with significant re- duction of risk after a median 13 years’ cumulative follow-up (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49-0.91).9 A systematic review suggested an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia with MP containing estrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT).4 A meta-analysis sug- gested increased risk of endometrial cancer (relative risk [RR], 1.2) with noncontinuous combined EPT (type of progestogen not specified) but not with continuous EPT.10 Oral MP should be a",

There are limited clinical trial data to support this use.13 In women using EPT, unscheduled bleeding occurring more than 6 months after initiation should be investigated. Tissue-selective estrogen complex Bazedoxifene, a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM; estrogen agonist or antagonist), has been combined with CEE to form a tissue-selective estrogen complex (TSEC). Studies of up to 2 years in duration suggest that the combination of BZA plus CEE provides endometrial protection without the need for a progestogen.7,14-16 In women using BZA plus CEE, unsched- uled bleeding occurring more than 6 months after initiation should be investigated. Dosing Estrogen therapy The therapeutic goal should be to use the most appropriate, often lowest, effective dose of systemic ET consistent with treat- ment goals. The appropriate dose of progestogen is added to provide endometrial protection if a woman has a uterus, unless CEE is combined with BZA. Progestogen therapy Progestogen dosing-regimen options that provide for endo- metrial safety are dependent on the potency of the progestogen and vary with the estrogen dose.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] iate dose of progestogen is added to provide endometrial protection if a woman has a uterus, unless CEE is combined with BZA. Progestogen therapy Progestogen dosing-regimen options that provide for endo- metrial safety are dependent on the potency of the progestogen and vary with the estrogen dose. Different types and doses of progestogens, routes of administration, and types of regimen (sequential or continuous-combined) may have different associ- ations with health outcomes, and patient preference can and should be considered because many women will opt for regi- mens that avoid periodic menstrual bleeding.17 Routes of administration For treating VMS, systemic estrogens can be prescribed as oral drugs; transdermal patches, sprays, and gels; or as vaginal rings. Meta-analysis of estrogen preparations found no evidence of a significant difference between transdermal EPT and oral EPT for alleviating VMS.18 Transdermal estradiol and oral CEE are similarly effective in alleviating VMS19; however, clinical trials directly comparing risk of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, breast cancer, and venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with various estrogen routes and doses are lacking. Progestogens are available as oral drugs or combination patches with estrogen. Nonoral routes of administration (eg, transdermal, vaginal) may offer potential advantages because nonoral routes bypass the first-pass hepatic effect; however, it is unknown whether nonoral routes of ET or EPT are associated with lower risk (vs oral routes) of VTE, breast cancer, and cardiovascular (CV) events because clinical trials have not been designed to examine those outcomes. Safety During the active treatment phase of the WHI, a higher inci- dence of breast cancer (risk is considered rare; in women assigned to CEE plus MPA compared with placebo but a reduced incidence in women assigned to CEE alone com- pared with placebo.20 After a median of 20 years’ follow-up (in- cluding intervention and postinterven",
    "[INTRODUCTION] phase of the WHI, a higher inci- dence of breast cancer (risk is considered rare; in women assigned to CEE plus MPA compared with placebo but a reduced incidence in women assigned to CEE alone com- pared with placebo.20 After a median of 20 years’ follow-up (in- cluding intervention and postintervention follow-up), the lower incidence of breast cancer in women assigned to CEE alone ver- sus placebo and the higher incidence of breast cancer in women assigned to CEE plus MPA persisted.21 In contrast to findings of the WHI, observational data have shown that breast cancer risk was increased in women using either systemic ET or EPT and was duration-dependent.22 Meta-analysis of studies in which most participants (70%) were aged older than 60 years and had some degree of comorbidity shows that EPT is associated with small increases in the risk of a coronary event (after 1 y), VTE (after 1 y), stroke (after 3 y), breast cancer (after 5 y), and gallbladder disease (after 5 y); ET (included oral, transdermal, subcutaneous, and intranasal prepa- rations without disaggregation of data by route of administration) increases the risk of VTE (after 1-2 y), stroke (after 7 y), and gall- bladder disease (after 7 y). One trial examined outcomes in women aged 50 to 59 years who were relatively healthy and found that the only significantly increased risk was of VTE in women on EPT.23 Although comparative RCT data are lacking, there may be less VTE risk associated with lower doses of oral ET than with higher doses.24,25 Observational studies have not demonstrated an increased risk of VTE with trans- dermal ET, and limited observational data suggest less risk with transdermal versus oral ET, but comparative RCT data again are lacking.26-28 The choice of progestogen may also af- fect risk for VTE, with MP potentially being less thrombogenic than other progestins.26,28 The WHI provided information on the rare risks of CEE com- bined with MPA.",

It is unknown whether oral MP-containing EPT similarly increases the risk of breast cancer, stroke, gallbladder disease, MI, or VTE because clinical trials have not yet been de- signed to examine these outcomes. Clinical trials are needed to establish the effect of different types of progestogens and different estrogen doses and administration routes on VTE risk.29 Overall, ET and EPT are each associated with rare increased risk of gall- bladder disease, stroke, VTE, and urinary incontinence; EPTalso is associated with increased risk of breast cancer.22,30 Studies NAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, Vol. 29, No. 7, 2022 769 were not designed to determine whether the combination of BZA plus CEE further increases the risk of VTE beyond the in- creased risk conferred by CEE alone. In women in the WHI aged 50 to 59 years, CEE plus MPA (average, 5.6 y of use) or CEE alone (average, 7.2 y of use in women with previous hysterectomy) did not increase cancer mortality or CV mortality after a median of 18 years’ follow-up compared with placebo. In women aged 50 to 59 years at ran- domization, all-cause mortality was significantly reduced in the pooled trials versus placebo (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51-0.94). With age groups combined, breast cancer mortality was reduced in women using CEE alone (HR 0.55; 95% CI, 0.33-0.92), and Alzheimer disease or dementia mortality was reduced in women using CEE alone (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.94) and in the pooled trials (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.98) after a median of 18 years’ follow-up.31 After a median of 20 years’ follow-up (including intervention and postintervention follow-up), the lower breast cancer mortality in women assigned to CEE alone vers",

Potential risks of hormone therapy for women aged younger than 60 years include the rare risk of breast cancer with EPT; en- dometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer with inadequately opposed estrogen; VTE; and gallbladder disease ( More common adverse events (AEs) include nausea, bloating, weight gain, fluid retention, mood swings (progestogen related), breakthrough bleeding, headaches, and breast tenderness. Key points • The appropriate, often lowest, effective dose of systemic ET consistent with treatment goals that provides benefits and minimizes risks for the individual woman should be the ther- apeutic goal.

(Level II) • The appropriate formulation, dose, and route of administra- tion of progestogen is needed to counter the proliferative ef- fects of systemic estrogen on the endometrium. (Level I) • Overall, the increased absolute risks associated with EPTand ET are rare (<10/10,000/y) and include increased risk for VTE and gallbladder disease. In addition, EPT carries a rare increased risk for stroke and breast cancer, and if estrogen is inadequately opposed, an increased risk of endometrial hy- perplasia and endometrial cancer. (Level I) • The absolute risks are reduced for all-cause mortality, fracture, diabetes mellitus (EPT and ET), and breast cancer (ET) in women aged younger than 60 years ( FDA-APPROVED INDICATIONS Vasomotor symptoms Hormone therapy has been shown in double-blind RCTs to relieve VMS32 and is FDA approved as first-line therapy for re- lief of moderate to severe VMS because of menopause.

Adapted from Manson JE, et al.9 NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 770 Menopause, Vol. 29, No. 7, 2022 © 2022 The North American Menopause Society Prevention of bone loss Hormone therapy has been shown in double-blind RCTs to prevent bone loss, and in the WHI, to reduce fractures in post- menopausal women without osteoporosis.33,34 The FDA indica- tion includes prevention, but not treatment, of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Nonestrogen medications are preferred for treat- ment of existing osteoporosis. Premature hypoestrogenism Hormone therapy is FDA approved for women with hypoestrogenism resulting from hypogonadism, bilateral oopho- rectomy (BO), or primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). Health benefits have been shown, with greater evidence for women with BO, for menopause symptoms and for prevention of bone loss and in observational studies, heart disease and cognitive decline or dementia.35-44 Genitourinary symptoms Hormone therapy has been shown in RCTs to effectively treat symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA).45,46 Hormone ther- apy is FDA approved to treat moderate to severe symptoms of VVA and dyspareunia because of menopause but with the pref- erence for low-dose vaginal therapy if solely prescribed for vul- var or vaginal symptoms. Two vaginal therapies, vaginal ET and vaginal dehydroepian- drosterone (DHEA), have been FDA approved for treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA resulting from menopause. One oral therapy (a SERM) has FDA approval as well.

FDA guidance for treatment of genitourinary symptoms related to menopause in the absence of indications for systemic ET suggests the use of low-dose topical vaginal ET. (Level I) COMPOUNDED BIOIDENTICAL HORMONES The term bioidentical hormone therapy (similar to endogenous) can be misleading because there are both government-approved and compounded bioidentical hormone therapies. Government- approved (in the United States, FDA-approved) bioidentical hormones include estradiol, estrone, and MP, which are regu- lated and monitored for purity and efficacy. These are dispensed with package inserts containing extensive product information (based on RCTs) and may include black-box warnings for AEs. In contrast, compounded bioidentical hormone therapies are pre- pared by a compounding pharmacist using a provider’s prescrip- tion. These therapies may combine multiple hormones (estradiol, estrone, estriol, DHEA, testosterone, progesterone) and use un- tested, unapproved combinations or formulations or are admin- istered in nonstandard or untested routes such as subdermal im- plants, pellets, or troches.47-50 Compounded bioidentical hormone therapy has been prescribed or dosed on the basis of serum, salivary, or urine hormone test- ing; however, the use of such testing to guide hormone therapy dosing is considered unreliable because of differences in hor- mone pharmacokinetics and absorption, diurnal variation, and interindividual and intraindividual variability.51-54 There is a dearth of safety and efficacy data with little or no high-quality pharmacokinetic data to provide evidence of safety and efficacy of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy and insufficient evidence to suppo",

Compounded bioidentical hormone therapy presents safety concerns, such as minimal government regulation and monitor- ing, overdosing and underdosing, presence of impurities and lack of sterility, lack of scientific efficacy and safety data, and lack of a label outlining risks.55 Patient preference for compounded bioidentical hormone therapy should be discussed.56 Prescribers should only consider compounded hormone therapy if women cannot tolerate a government-approved therapy for reasons such as allergies to ingredients in a government-approved hormone therapy formu- lation or for a dose or formulation not currently available in government-approved therapies. Patient preference alone should not be used to justify use of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy. Prescribers of compounded bioidentical hormone ther- apy should document the medical indication for a compounded bioidentical hormone over government-approved therapies.55 In addition to including financial disclosures of prescribers, pharmacists, and pharmacies, compounding pharmacists should provide standardized content information, include warnings for potential AEs, note that the preparation is not government ap- proved, and provide guidance on reporting AEs.

Considering the dose, there are no appreciable differences in the efficacy of oral versus nonoral formulations, but EPT appears slightly more effective than ET alone.

Lower doses of hormone therapy (oral CEE 0.3 mg; oral 17β- estradiol ≤0.5 mg; or estradiol patch 0.025 mg) may take 6 to 8 weeks to provide adequate symptom relief. Although the low- est dose-approved estradiol weekly patch (0.014 mg/d) appears effective in treating VMS,66 it is FDA approved only for preven- tion of osteoporosis. Progestogen-only formulations have been found to be effective in treating VMS,67,68 including MPA 10 mg,69 oral megestrol acetate 20 mg,70 and MP 300 mg.68 No long-term studies have addressed the safety of progestogen-only treatment of meno- pause symptoms. Vasomotor symptoms return in approximately 50% of women when hormone therapy is discontinued.71,72 There is no consensus about whether stopping abruptly or gradually tapering the dose is preferable. Sleep disturbances Sleep disturbances are common after menopause and begin in perimenopause. Sleep disruptions are strongly associated with VMS and a decreased quality of life. Poorer sleep quality has been associated with mood fluctuations, memory problems, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and other CV risk factors. Short (or very long) sleep duration, poor sleep quality, and insomnia have been asso- ciated with greater cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.73-76 Hormone therapy in the form of low-dose estrogen or proges- togen may improve chronic insomnia in menopausal women, with 14 of 23 studies reviewed showing positive results.77 There is some evidence that transdermal ET may benefit sleep in peri- menopausal women, independent of VMS.78 Oral MP has mildly sedating effects, reducing wakefulness without affecting daytime cognitive functions, possibly through a GABA-agonistic effect,79 and should therefore be adminis- tered at night.",

A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that MP improved sleep-onset latency but not sleep duration or sleep efficiency in RCTs in postmenopausal women.80 Genitourinary symptoms The genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) includes the signs and symptoms associated with menopause-related es- trogen deficiency involving changes to the labia, vagina, urethra, and bladder and includes VVA.81 Symptoms may include genital dryness, burning, and irritation; sexual symptoms of diminished lubrication and pain with sexual activity; and urinary symptoms of urgency, dysuria, and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI). Estrogen therapy, specifically vaginal ET, is an effective treatment for GSM, with no evidence to suggest a difference in safety or ef- ficacy between the various vaginal ET preparations.45,82,83 Low-dose vaginal ET preparations include creams, tablets, rings, and a softgel vaginal insert. The different preparations all contain estradiol, and one cream preparation contains CEE. One ring is available for long-term (3 mo) delivery of low-dose estradiol to the vagina, but another is aimed at providing systemic levels of estradiol.

The low-dose vaginal estradiol products avail- able result in minimal systemic absorption.84-86 It is preferred to insert vaginal products (except for the vaginal ring) in the prox- imal, lower third of the vagina rather than in the upper third. This improves efficacy for genitourinary symptoms and attenu- ates estradiol absorption.86 Because of the potential risk of small increases in circulating estrogens,87 the decision to use low-dose vaginal ET in women with breast cancer should be made in conjunction with their on- cologists.88,89 This is particularly important for women on aroma- tase inhibitors (AIs) with suppressed plasma levels of estradiol,90 although no increased risk was seen in an observational trial of survivors of breast cancer on tamoxifen or aromatase therapy with low-dose vaginal ET during 3.5 years’ mean follow-up.91 A progestogen is generally not indicated when ET is adminis- tered vaginally for GSM at the recommended low doses, although clinical trial data supporting endometrial safety beyond 1 year are lacking.85 Vaginal bleeding in a postmenopausal woman requires thorough evaluation. Long-term follow up of women in the WHI observational study and in the Nurses’ Health Study who used vaginal ET indicated no increased risk of adverse CVor cancer outcomes.92,93 Nonestrogen therapies that improve genitourinary symptoms and are approved for relief of dyspareunia in postmenopausal women include ospemifene94 and intravaginal DHEA.95 Urinary tract symptoms (including pelvic floor disorders) Vaginal ETincreases the number of vessels around the periurethral and bladder neck region96 and has been shown to reduce the frequency and amplitude of detrusor contractions to promote detrusor muscle relaxation.97,98 Estrogen therapy, along with pelvic floor training, pessaries, or surgery, may improve synthe- sis of collagen and improve vaginal epithelium, but evidence for effectiveness for pelvic organ prola",

A reduced risk of recurrent UTIs with vaginal but not oral estrogen has been shown in RCTs.103,104 Sexual function Systemic hormone therapy and low-dose vaginal ET provide effective treatment of GSM, improving sexual problems by in- creasing lubrication, blood flow, and sensation in vaginal tis- sues.105 Studies have not found a significant effect of ET on NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 772 Menopause, Vol. 29, No. 7, 2022 © 2022 The North American Menopause Society sexual interest, arousal, and orgasmic response independent from its role in treating menopause symptoms.106-108 If systemic hormone therapy is indicated in women with low libido, transdermal ET formulations may be preferred to oral, given increased sex hormone-binding globulin and reduced bio- availability of testosterone with oral ET.105,109,110 Conjugated equine estrogens combined with BZA relieves dyspareunia and improves some aspects of sexual function in postmenopausal women.111-114 Key points Vasomotor symptoms • Vasomotor symptoms may begin during perimenopause, and frequent VMS may persist on average 7.4 years or longer.",

(Level I) PRIMARY OVARIAN INSUFFICIENCY Women with loss of ovarian function at a young age experi- ence an extended period without ovarian hormones compared with women experiencing menopause at the typical age. Prema- ture menopause is defined as menopause before age 40 years, and early menopause is defined as menopause that occurs be- tween the ages of 40 and 45 years. Whereas menopause implies the permanent cessation of menses, POI describes the loss of ovarian function before age 40 years but with the potential for intermittent, transient return of hormone production and men- strual cycles. Women with early or premature loss of ovarian function at any age are at increased risk for AEs related to ovar- ian hormone deficiency. Causes of early or premature loss of ovarian function may be genetic, autoimmune, toxic, metabolic, and iatrogenic, including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. Health risks of POI and premature menopause are well docu- mented.40,41 The strongest evidence from meta-analyses and systematic reviews links early loss of ovarian function to de- creased quality of life and increased risk of fracture, CVD, heart failure, diabetes mellitus (DM), and overall mortality.115-121 Other significant issues may include persistent VMS, loss o",
    "[INTRODUCTION] 1 The strongest evidence from meta-analyses and systematic reviews links early loss of ovarian function to de- creased quality of life and increased risk of fracture, CVD, heart failure, diabetes mellitus (DM), and overall mortality.115-121 Other significant issues may include persistent VMS, loss of fertility, bone loss, genitourinary symptoms, sexual dysfunction, cogni- tive and mood changes, and increased risk of dementia, ophthal- mic conditions, and depression.40,41,122-124 Although these risks are generally because of estrogen deficiency, some of these risks may be reflective of premature aging, as evidenced in some studies by shortened telomere length.125 NAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, Vol. 29, No. 7, 2022 773 In addition to an increased risk of incident CVD, POI and pre- mature menopause are associated with an increased risk of aortic stenosis, VTE, ischemic stroke, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension.123,126 Early menopause is also as- sociated with a decreased risk of breast cancer.127 The surgical removal of both ovaries leads to a much more abrupt loss of the ovarian steroids estrogen and progesterone than does natural menopause and includes a significant decrease in testosterone that does not occur with natural menopause.128 Vasomotor symptoms as well as a variety of estrogen deficiency- related symptoms and diseases are more frequent and more se- vere after oophorectomy and can have a major effect on quality of life.129,130 In meta-analyses, oophorectomy is associated with an increased risk of CVD,131 cognitive dysfunction and dementia,132 metabolic syndrome,133 low bone mineral density (BMD),134 and sleep disturbance,135 with some evidence for elevated frac- ture risk.136 Bilateral oophorectomy before age 40 is associated with elevated rates of incident CVD as well as mitral regurgita- tion, VTE, heart failure, coronary artery disease, and hyperten- sion.123 Other risks may include depression, anxiety, sexual dys- functi",

(Level II) SKIN, HAIR, AND SPECIAL SENSES Estrogen therapy may benefit wound healing through modi- fying inflammation, stimulating granulation tissue formation, and accelerating re-epithelialization. Estrogen therapy increased epidermal and dermal thickness, increased collagen and elastin content, and improved skin moisture, with fewer wrinkles.144 Although menopause is associated with a decrease in hair den- sity and female pattern hair loss, research on the role of hormone therapy in mitigating these changes is lacking.145 In the WHI, ET reduced intraocular pressure in postmeno- pausal women and mitigated the risk for open-angle glaucoma in Black women.146,147 Similar effects were not seen for EPT.148 Further, hormone therapy decreased the risk of neovascular and soft drusen age-related macular degeneration but not early or late-stage macular degeneration.149 Evidence on the effect of hor- mone therapyon cataract, dryeye disease, and optic nerve disorders is mixed, and good-quality RCTs are lacking.150-152 Observational data linking hormone therapy to hearing loss is mixed.153,154 Little is known about olfactory changes and hormone ther- apy.155 In small trials, hormone therapy appears to decrease diz- ziness or vertigo and improve postural balance.156,157 Key points • Estrogen therapy appears to have beneficial effects on skin thickness and elasticity and collagen when given at meno- pause.

(Level II) HORMONE THERAPY AND QUALITY OF LIFE Quality of life is defined as an overall assessment of one’s life in relation to one’s goals and expectations. Quality of life can be applied to one’s mental and physical health, which is termed health-related quality of life, or specifically to menopause, or menopause-specific quality of life, which emphasizes the bother and interference of menopause symptoms. Clinical trials indi- cate that in women with menopause symptoms, such as VMS, systemic hormone therapy (ET, EPT, TSECs) can improve menopause-specific quality of life.158-160 These effects appear to be explained largely by the effect of hormone therapy on the frequency of these symptoms.

(Level II) • Systemic hormone therapy can improve menopause-specific quality of life in women experiencing menopause symptoms. (Level II) OSTEOPOROSIS Menopause is associated with increased bone resorption, and ET decreases bone resorption.161 For osteoporosis treatment, hormone therapy has not been demonstrated in RCTs to reduce fractures in postmenopausal women with established osteoporo- sis; therefore, hormone therapy does not carry an FDA indica- tion for treatment of osteoporosis.162,163 In women who have osteoporosis, hormone therapy has not been demonstrated in RCTs to decrease fracture risk. In the WHI, for women aged 50 to 79 years (N = 16,608), enrolled without regard to bone density or fracture risk, EPT (0.625 mg CEE plus 2.5 mg MPA) significantly increased lumbar spine and total hip BMD by 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively, relative to placebo and reduced fracture risk.34 The BMD benefits of pre- venting bone loss persist as long as therapy is continued but abate rapidly when treatment is discontinued. Within a few months, markers of bone turnover returned to pretreatment values, whereas BMD fell to pretreatment levels within 1 to 2 years of stopping therapy.164 Women with POI experience long-term AEs on bone density, in addition to other health risks.35,140 Higher-than-standard doses of hormone therapy may be needed to provide protection against bone-density loss in younger women, particularly those aged younger than 40 years and thus lower future osteoporotic fracture risk.140,165 In the setting of prevention, RCTs show that hormone therapy decreases fracture risk.162,163 Various oral and transdermal es- trogen preparations, alone or in combination with progestogens or BZA, have government approval for prevention of osteoporosis.",

A meta-analysis and a systematic review, based primarily on the WHI, demonstrated that 5 to 7 years of hormone therapy signifi- cantly reduced risk of spine, hip, and nonvertebral fractures.166,167 During the WHI intervention phase in women of all ages, the CEE plus MPA group had six fewer hip fractures per 10,000 women and six fewer vertebral fractures per 10,000 women compared with the placebo group.9 The CEE-alone group had six fewer hip fractures per 10,000 women and six fewer vertebral fractures per 10,000 women compared with the placebo group. However, in the subset of women aged 50 to 59 years at the time of treatment initiation, neither CEE plus MPA nor CEE alone was associated with decreased risk of hip fracture. The reason that hormone therapy was not shown to reduce hip fracture in the subset of women aged 50 to 59 years in the WHI may be partly because of the lower baseline absolute risk of frac- ture in women aged between 50 and 59 years who did not have established osteoporosis.9,168 In the WHI hormone therapy trials, after hormone therapy discontinuation, there was a return of fracture risk to levels seen in women who had received placebo, with no excess fracture risk observed after discontinuation of hormone therapy.169,170 There are no prospective fracture studies directly comparing the efficacy of hormone therapy in preventing fractures with other approved pharmacologic therapies.

(Level I) • Hormone therapy is FDA approved for prevention of bone loss, but not for treatment of osteoporosis. (Level I) • In the absence of contraindications, in women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, sys- temic hormone therapy is an appropriate therapy to protect against bone loss. (Level I) • Unless contraindicated, women with premature menopause without prior fragility fracture or osteoporosis are best served with hormone therapy or oral contraceptives to prevent bone density loss and reduce fracture risk, rather than other bone-specific treatments, until the average age of menopause, when treatment may be reassessed. (Level II) • Decisions regarding initiation and discontinuation of hormone therapy should be made primarily on the basis of extraskeletal benefits (ie, reduction of VMS) and risks. (Level III) JOINT PAIN Direct binding of estrogen to estrogen receptors acts on joint tissues, protecting their biomechanical structure and function and maintaining overall joint health, but the exact effect of estro- gen on osteoarthritis remains controversial.171-173 There is no clearly observed association between hormone therapy use and osteoarthritis.171 Meta-analyses of clinical trials of ET have reported inconsistent results.

The EPT trial showed no relationship between hormone use and arthroplasty risk.176 Key points • Women in the WHI and other studies have less joint pain or stiff- ness with hormone therapy compared with placebo. (Level I) • There is a need for further understanding of estrogen’s poten- tial effect on joint health. (Level III) SARCOPENIA Frailty is associated with AEs such as falls, hospitalization, disability, and death.177 Skeletal muscle has been shown to have estrogen receptors,178 but there is a paucity of studies evaluating the interplay between estrogen and muscle.

Key points • Development of frailty with aging is a health risk. (Level I) • Sarcopenia and osteoporosis are related to aging, estrogen depletion, and the menopause transition. (Level II) • Intervention to improve bioenergetics and prevent loss of mus- cle mass, strength, and performance is needed. (Level III) • Preclinical studies suggest a possible benefit of ET when combined with exercise to prevent the loss of muscle mass, strength, and performance, but this has not been shown in clinical trials.

Animal models have demonstrated a causal relationship between the loss of estrogen and increase in fatty liver and steatohepatitis, whereas observa- tional studies show dietary factors also may exacerbate liver dis- ease. Preclinical and observational studies suggest possible ben- efits of hormone therapy on liver fibrosis and fatty liver,192 but more research is needed before definitive recommendations can be made.

(Level II) DIABETES MELLITUS, METABOLIC SYNDROME, AND BODY COMPOSITION Metabolic syndrome and diabetes In the WHI, women receiving continuous-combined CEE plus MPA had a statistically significant 19% reduction (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.94; P = .005) in the incidence of type 2 DM, translating to 16 fewer cases per 10,000 person-years of therapy.9 In the CEE-alone cohort, there was a reduction of 14% in new di- agnoses of type 2 DM (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.98), translat- ing to 21 fewer cases per 10,000 person-years. A meta-analysis of published studies found that EPT reduced multiple components of the metabolic syndrome; incidence of type 2 DM was de- creased by 30%.193 A second, smaller meta-analysis confirmed these findings and reported that women with type 2 DM using ET or EPT had better glycemic control.194 The benefit reverses when hormone therapy is discontinued. For these reasons, hor- mone therapy can be considered for symptomatic menopausal women with type 2 DM.

Estrogen-progestogen therapy either has no effect on weight or is associated with less weight gain in women who are using it than in women who are not.198-202 In the WHI, women ran- domized to hormone therapy with CEE with or without MPA had no statistically significant difference in slowing of weight gain and a lesser increase in waist circumference over the first 3 years of use compared with those randomized to placebo. In- creasing physical activity was independently associated with less weight gain over time.195 Key points • Hormone therapy significantly reduces the diagnosis of new-onset type 2 DM, but it is not government approved for this indication. (Level I) • Hormone therapy is not contraindicated in otherwise healthy women with preexisting type 2 DM and may be beneficial in terms of glycemic control when used for menopause symp- tom management. (Level II) • Although hormone therapy may help attenuate abdominal adipose accumulation and weight gain associated with the menopause transition, the effect is small.

    "[INTRODUCTION] large RCTs demonstrated neutral effects of hormone therapy on cognitive function when used early in the postmenopause period.205-207 Two hypotheses—the critical window or timing hypothesis and the healthy-cell bias hypothesis—provide a framework for understanding the scientific literature on hormone therapy and cognition, but neither has been definitively supported in RCTs of postmenopausal women. The critical window or timing hy- pothesis208,209 holds that estrogen can confer cognitive benefits if given early in the menopause transition but that later use is neutral or detrimental. The healthy-cell bias hypothesis210 holds that estrogen confers cognitive benefits when the neural substrate is “healthy” but not diseased, for example in a woman with DM. Later initiation of hormone therapy Several large clinical trials indicate that hormone therapy does not improve memory or other cognitive abilities and that CEE plus MPA may be harmful for memory when initiated in women aged older than 65 years.211-213 Alzheimer disease Four observational studies provide support for the opinion that the timing of hormone therapy initiation is a significant de- terminant of Alzheimer disease risk, with early initiation lower- ing risk and later initiation associated with increased risk.214-217 However, long-term effects may differ from short-term effects. Eighteen-year follow-up data from the WHI showed a reduction in Alzheimer disease mortality in women randomized to hor- mone therapy; this effect was significant for CEE alone but not for CEE plus MPA and was driven by women aged in their 70s at the time of enrollment.31 Two nested case-control studies investigated the risk of dementia associated with hormone ther- apy use and showed no increased risk overall but did suggest an increased risk of Alzheimer disease, specifically, with the use of EPT for more than 5 years.218 All-cause dementia In the WHI Memory Study, CEE plus MPA doubled the risk of all-cause dementia (23 cases/10,000",

(Level I) • Initiating hormone therapy in women aged older than 65 years increased the risk for dementia, with an additional 23 cases per 10,000 person-years seen in women randomized to CEE plus MPA in the WHI Memory Study. (Level I) • The effect of hormone therapy may be modified by baseline cognitive function, with more favorable effects in women with normal cognitive function before hormone therapy initi- ation. (Level II) • Estrogen therapy may have cognitive benefits when initiated immediately after hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy, but hormone therapy in the early natural postmenopause pe- riod has neutral effects on cognitive function. (Level II) DEPRESSION Depressive symptoms worsen as women transition through menopause, although evidence is mixed as to whether depres- sive disorders are more common during the menopause transi- tion relative to premenopause.

Vasomotor symptoms increase the risk for elevated depressive symptoms, in part because of nocturnal VMS and sleep inter- ruption,224 and on a day-to-day basis, VMS co-occur with neg- ative mood and predict negative mood the next day.225 Vasomo- tor symptoms appear to be more strongly associated with the onset of depressive symptoms than depressive disorders.226 Estrogen therapy shows some efficacy in the management of depression in midlife women, but its effect varies by menopause stage. For perimenopausal women with depression, there is evi- dence that ET improves depressive symptoms to a degree simi- lar to antidepressant medications.227 This antidepressant effect of ET applies to perimenopausal women with and without VMS. In women with major depression treated with ET, depres- sive symptoms improve in relation to improvements in sleep but not VMS.228 Estrogen therapy does not appear to be effective in treating depressive disorders in postmenopausal women, sug- gesting a window of opportunity in the perimenopause.229 Little is known about the effects of EPT in treating depressive disor- ders at any menopause stage.",

There is some evidence that ETenhances mood and improves well-being in nondepressed postmenopausal women.205 Initial evidence suggests that hormone therapy (specifically transder- mal estradiol with intermittent MP) may prevent the onset of de- pressive symptoms in euthymic perimenopausal women.230 Estrogen therapy may augment clinical response to antidepres- sants in midlife and older women, preferably when also indicated for other concurrent menopause-related symptoms such as VMS.231 Key points • There is some evidence that ET has antidepressant effects of similar magnitude to that observed with antidepressant agents when administered to depressed perimenopausal women with or without concomitant VMS.

(Level I) CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY Observational data and reanalysis of older studies by age or time since menopause, including the WHI, suggest that for healthy women who are within 10 years of the menopause transition and who have bothersome menopause symptoms, the benefits of hor- mone therapy (ET or EPT) outweigh its risks, with fewer CVD events in younger versus older women.9,31,219,232-242 Initiation of hormone therapy fewer than 10 years after menopause onset Surrogate markers of coronary heart disease Surrogate markers of CHD are intermediate measures that have been associated with the development of CVD and events such as coronary artery calcification (CAC) and subclinical ath- erosclerosis. Some studies have suggested that initiating hormone therapy in symptomatic women within 10 years of menopause may have benefit in reduction of atherosclerosis progression as measured by CAC,243-245 whereas RCTs in younger, re- cently postmenopausal women have not.246,247 In the Early Versus Late Intervention Trial With Estradiol, hormone therapy (oral 17β-estradiol 1 mg/d plus progesterone vaginal gel 45 mg administered sequentially for women with a uterus) reduced subclinical atherosclerosis progression measured by carotid ar- tery intima-media thickness after a median of 5 years when ini- tiated within 6 years (median, 3.5 y) of menopause onset but not when initiated 10 or more years (me",

A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs pub- lished from 2000 to 2019 showed null effects of hormone therapy initiated fewer than 10 years after menopause or at an age youn- ger than 60 years on all-cause mortality, stroke, and VTE.248 A 2019 systematic review and meta-regression analysis of RCTs that examined the timing hypothesis of hormone therapy compared with controls or nonusers of hormone therapy found that younger hormone therapy initiation (participants aged <60 y) was associated with lower odds of CHD (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37-1.00), all-cause mortality (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57-0.91), and cardiac mortality (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37-1.00) but with higher odds of a composite measure of incidence stroke, transient ischemic attack, and systemic embolism (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.10-1.78).249 However, the results for CHD, cardiac mortality, and all-cause mortality were all attenuated after excluding open-label trials in which the knowledge of active treatment may aff",

Cardiovascular outcomes in the Women’s Health Initiative Intervention phase For CEE alone, CHD, MI, and coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention showed a lowered HR in women aged younger than 60 years and fewer than 10 years since menopause onset, including in intention-to-treat analyses.9 In the 50- to 59-year-old age group, the HR for CHD was elevated but not statistically significant at 1.34 (95% CI, 0.82-2.19) for CEE plus MPA. When data from the two WHI trials were combined and analyzed, a reduction in all-cause mortality was shown in younger but not in older women; HRs in women aged 50 to 59 years, 60 to 69 years, and 70 to 79 years were 0.69 (95% CI, 0.51-0.94), 1.04 (95% CI, 0.87-1.25), and 1.13 (95% CI, 0.94-1.36), respectively ( Pfor trend = .01).31 Cumulative follow-up For CEE alone, in the 13-year cumulative intervention and post- intervention follow-up, significant age-treatment interaction was shown for MI such that only in the 50- to 59-year-old age group a reduction in MI risk was significant (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39- 0.91).9 Although a similar interaction was not significant for CHD and all-cause mortality, there was a significant reduction in CHD risk (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.96) in this age group.",

In the 18-year intervention and postintervention cumulative follow- up, the reduction in all-cause mortality was shown to be statistically significant for the 50- to 59-year-old age group (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.96),31 although interaction between age and treatment was not significant. Additional analysis focusing on oophorectomy sta- tus in the CEE-alone trial revealed a significant age-treatment inter- action for all-cause mortality; younger women with BO assigned to CEE alone showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with placebo (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48-0.96).242 Initiation of hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopause onset or in women aged older than 60 years For women who initiated hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopause onset or aged older than 60 years, a 2015 Cochrane meta-analysis found no evidence that hormone ther- apy had an effect on CHD (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.96-1.20) or all-cause mortality (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.95-1.18), with an aver- age follow-up of 3.8 years.236 There was an increased risk of stroke (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06-1.38) and VTE (RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.37-2.80). A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs showed similar results as the 2015 Cochrane analysis for older women who initiated hormone therapy.248 Compared with placebo or nonusers of hormone therapy, initiating hormone therapy in women aged 60 years or older or after 10 years since menopause had a null effect on CHD (summary estimate, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.87-1.14) and all-cause mortality (summary estimate, 1.00; 95% CI 0.96-1.05) but was associated with higher risk of stroke (summary estimate, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.37) and VTE (sum- mary estimate, 1.79",

Similarly, in a 2019 systematic review and meta-regression analysis of RCTs testing the timing hypothesis, women who ini- tiated hormone therapy relative to placebo or nonusers of hor- mone therapy aged 60 years or older showed a null effect on CHD and all-cause mortality but was associated with higher risk of a composite measure of incidence stroke, transient ischemic attack, and systemic embolism (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.39-1.71).249 Attributable risk of stroke in women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset The 2015 Cochrane meta-analysis found no increased risk of stroke in women who initiated hormone therapy aged younger than 60 years or fewer than 10 years from menopause onset.236 In subgroup analysis, the attributable risk of stroke in the WHI for women who initiated hormone therapy aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset was rare (<10/10,000 person-years) and statistically nonsignificant for CEE plus MPA, with an absolute risk of 5 per 10,000 person- years,9,240 similar to other studies.232 Findings were inconsistent for CEE-alone in the WHI. For women aged 50 to 59 years at randomization, a decrease of 1 per 10,000 person-years was seen for stroke; whereas for women fewer than 10 years from menopause onset, an increase in 13 strokes per 10,000 person-years was seen.9 On the basis of only observational studies, lower doses of either oral250 or transdermal251 estrogen may confer less risk of stroke; no clear association with age has been found.

Venous thromboembolism Women who began hormone therapy fewer than 10 years af- ter menopause onset or who were aged younger than 60 years have higher risk of VTE compared with placebo (RR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.11-2.73), according to the 2015 Cochrane meta- analysis.236 In a 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs published between 2000 and 2019, risk of VTE was ele- vated in women who initiated hormone therapy aged older than 60 years or after 10 years since menopause (summary estimate, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.39-2.29) and a null effect in women who initiated hormone therapy aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause (summary estimate, 0.69; 95% CI 0.25-1.93).248 Lower doses of oral ET may confer less risk of VTE than higher doses,24,25 but comparative RCT data are lacking. Micronized progesterone may be less thrombogenic than other progestins.26 Transdermal hormone therapy has not been associated with VTE risk in observational studies, limited observational data and a sys- tematic review suggest less risk with transdermal hormone therapy than oral26,27,29; however, comparative RCT data are lacking. Areas of scientific uncertainty and need for randomized, controlled trial data Although observational studies, meta-analyses of RCTs, and smaller RCTs with surrogate CVD risk markers suggest that hormone therapy may reduce CVD risk when initiated in women aged younger than 60 years and/or who are within 10 years of menopause onset, significant research gaps remain regarding dose, formulation, route of delivery, and duration of use.

Furthermore, NAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, Vol. 29, No. 7, 2022 779 because most RCTs are performed on North American and European women, future studies should also evaluate the role of ethnicity with respect to hormone therapy and CVD. Data are insufficient for risk related to long-term hormone therapy use in perimenopausal women and in postmenopausal women aged younger than 50 years.23,252 Hormone therapy is not govern- ment approved for prevention of CVD. Key points • For healthy symptomatic women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, the favorable effects of hormone therapy on CHD and all-cause mortality should be considered against potential rare increases in risks of breast cancer, VTE, and stroke.

(Level I) BREAST CANCER Breast cancer affects approximately one in eight US women, so an understanding of the potential effect of hormone therapy on breast cancer risk is of considerable importance. Potential differences of the effects of ET, EPT, and CEE plus BZA on breast tissue may exist. Different types of estrogen or progesto- gen, as well as different formulations, timing of initiation, dura- tion of therapy, and patient characteristics, may play a role in the effects of hormone therapy on the breast. Estrogen-progestogen therapy In the WHI, daily continuous-combined CEE plus MPA re- sulted in an increased risk of breast cancer, with nine additional breast cancer cases per 10,000 person-years of therapy.9 The HR remained elevated at a median of 20 years’ cumulative follow-up in the unblended, postintervention phase (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.13-1.45).21 Estrogen-alone therapy Compared with women who received placebo, women who received CEE alone in the WHI showed a nonsignificant reduction in breast cancer risk after an average of 7.2 years of ran- domization, with seven fewer cases of invasive breast cancer per 10,000 person-years of CEE (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02).9 A sig- nificant reduction in breast cancer became evident in the postinter- vention phase, with a median 20 years’ cumulative follow-up (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65-0.93).21 Longer duration of hormone therapy use No large RCTs have assessed the effect of long duration of hormone the",

Both the ET and the EPT components of the WHI reported data for finite intervals because both were terminated early because of predefined safety considerations, with a median of 7.2 years for ET and 5.6 for EPT. Notably, al- though long-term follow-up at 13 and 20 years provided infor- mation about use for 5 to 7 years, no data were available regard- ing longer-term use. The recent pooled analysis of observational data in the Collaborative Group Study included information on duration of hormone therapy use in women starting hormone therapy when aged 45 to 54 years.22 In each age category, the risk of breast cancer increased with duration of use. Specifically, for ET, the HRs increased from 1.23 (95% CI, 1.11-1.35) for 1 to 4 years of use, to 1.29 (95% CI, 1.21-1.37) for 5 to 9 years, to 1.44 (95% CI, 1.35-1.53) for 10 to 14 years, and to 1.61 (95% CI, 1.49-1.74) for 15 or more years.

Attributable risk of breast cancer The attributable risk of breast cancer in women (mean age, 63 y) randomized to CEE plus MPA in the WHI is less than one addi- tional case of breast cancer diagnosed per 1,000 users annually,9 a risk slightly greater than that observed with one daily glass of wine, less than with two daily glasses, and similar to the risk re- ported with obesity and low physical activity.253,254 Compared with placebo or nonusers of hormone therapy, there appears to be no additive effect of hormone therapy with age or elevated personal b",

Role of type of hormone use, dose, and route of administration Some but not all observational data suggest that MP and dydrogesterone may have a lesser association with breast can- cer, whereas other synthetic progestogens such as MPA may have a more adverse effect.268 Randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings. Preclinical data suggest that CEE may have lesser effects on occult breast cancer growth than estradiol,269 but clinical data from observational studies, such as the Collaborative Group study, do not report a difference.22 Regarding route, both oral and transdermal estrogens appear to have similar effects on number of breast cancers diagnosed, whereas vaginal estrogens have no effect. Insufficient clinical data on newer therapies such as TSECs, including CEE plus BZA, are available to assess their breast cancer risk,270 al- though preclinical data suggest greater safety.271 Mammographic breast density and hormone therapy Different hormone therapy regimens may be associated with increased breast density, which may obscure mammographic in- terpretation.272 More mammograms and breast biopsies were performed in women receiving CEE plus MPA than placebo in the WHI.273 In trials up to 2-years’ duration, breast cancer, breast density, and breast tenderness showed no difference be- tween oral CEE plus BZA and placebo.274-276 Hormone therapy after breast cancer Two RCTs reported conflicting outcomes of breast cancer re- currence with hormone therapy.",

One study (“Hormonal Replace- ment Therapy After Breast Cancer—Is It Safe?”) showed an ele- vated risk of breast cancer recurrence in hormone therapy users relative to nonusers after a median follow-up of 2.1 years (HR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.5-8.1)277 and 4 years, (HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3- 4.2),278 whereas another trial (Stockholm Breast Cancer Study) showed no effect on breast cancer recurrence in hormone ther- apy users relative to nonusers after median follow-up of 4.1 years (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.35-1.9)279 and 10.8 years (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9-1.9) but did show an increased risk of breast cancer in the contralateral breast (HR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.2-10.9).280 Although systemic use of hormone therapy in survivors of breast cancer is generally not advised, if symptoms of estrogen deficiency are severe and unresponsive to nonhormone options, women, in consultation with their oncologists, may choose hor- mone therapy after being fully informed about the risks and ben- efits. Several observational studies in women with a history of breast cancer have shown a decreased risk of recurrent breast cancer or neutral effects compared with nonusers.281-286 In addition, mortality was reported to be reduced in breast cancer survivors who used hormone therapy relative to those who did not.282,284 Four meta-analyses reported similar findings.281,284-286 A confounding factor in all of these observational studies is that women at low risk of breast cancer recurrence are more likely to elect hormone therapy use than women at high risk.

    "[INTRODUCTION] factor in all of these observational studies is that women at low risk of breast cancer recurrence are more likely to elect hormone therapy use than women at high risk. Low-dose vaginal ET remains an effective treatment option for GSM in survivors of breast cancer, with minimal systemic absorption. Treatment with low-dose vaginal ET or DHEA may be considered if symptoms persist after an initial trial of nonhormone therapies and in consultation with an oncologist, with more concern for women on AIs.88,90 Breast cancer mortality and hormone therapy Only one randomized trial, the WHI, examined breast cancer- specific mortality. After 20 years of median cumulative follow-up, CEE alonewas associated with significantly lower breast cancer in- cidence (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65-0.93) and breast cancer mortality (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37-0.97) compared with placebo. In con- trast, CEE plus MPA was associated with significantly higher breast cancer incidence (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.13-1.45) but no significant difference in breast cancer mortality (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.94-1.95) compared with placebo.21 The mortality risk of breast cancer in hormone therapy users has been reported to be reduced in many but not all observational studies.287-295 The breast cancers in hormone therapy users (ET and EPT) appear in most (but not all) studies to have more benign histologic features (localized, smaller, better differentiated, lower mean tumor proliferation rate) than in hormone therapy nonusers. The most recent study, using a large data registry in Finland and comparing populations rates, reported a reduction in breast can- cer mortality in users of both ETand EPT.296 A confounding fac- tor in all these studies is that hormone therapy users undergo more frequent mammograms and diagnostic examinations, espe- cially with occurrence of signs or symptoms.297-301 This is likely to result in earlier diagnosis and therefore more benign histologic features and lower mortality.",

Key points • The risk of breast cancer related to hormone therapy use is low, with estimates indicating a rare occurrence (less than one additional case per 1,000 women per year of hormone therapy use or three additional cases per 1,000 women when used for 5 years with CEE plus MPA). (Level I) • Women should be counseled about the risk of breast cancer with hormone therapy, putting the data into perspective, with risk similar to that of modifiable risk factors such as two daily alcoholic beverages, obesity, and low physical activity.

Greater risk is seen with higher estrogen doses used for longer duration, and risk persists after discontinuation. Progestogen used contin- uously or cyclically for 10 to 14 days monthly significantly reduces this risk. With long-duration hormone therapy use, observa- tional studies suggest a potentially increased risk of endometrial cancer with cyclic progestogen regimens compared with contin- uous progestogen use and with the use of MP compared with other progestogens.3,4,302 In the WHI, women with a uterus re- ceiving EPT had a lower risk of endometrial cancer than women randomized to placebo after 13 years of cumulative follow-up because of the baseline risk of endometrial cancer in postmeno- pausal women from endogenous estrogen production.9 Ade- quate concomitant progestogen is recommended for a woman with an intact uterus when using systemic ET. Low-dose vaginal ET does not appear to increase endometrial cancer risk,92,93 although trials with endometrial biopsy end points are limited to 1 year in duration. Progestogen is not ad- vised in women using low-dose vaginal ET for the treatment of GSM, although intermittent use may be considered in women at increased risk of endometrial cancer. Postmenopausal bleed- ing must be evaluated thoroughly in any woman, whether she is using hormone therapy or not, because this may be a sign of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. Hormone therapy after endometrial cancer Although hormone therapy is generally contraindicated in women with estrogen-responsive cancers, hormone therapy may be used to treat bothersome menopause symptoms in women with low-grade, Stage I endometrial cancer after hysterectomy.

In the WHI, there was no significant increase in ovarian cancer risk with EPT.9 Hormone therapy after ovarian cancer The use of hormone therapy after a diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer does not appear to affect recurrence risk or sur- vival.312,313 Although most studies are observational, this finding also is supported by two RCTs. Several studies identify improved survival in women with ovarian cancer who use hormone therapy, but this likely represents selection bias.307 Use of hormone ther- apy is not advised in women with hormone-dependent ovarian cancers, including granulosa-cell tumors and serous carcino- mas.306,314 Tumors of low malignant potential (borderline) often affect younger women, with excellent survival rates.

(Level II) COLORECTAL CANCER Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in US women.309 Risk fac- tors include physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and decreased use of screening strategies, which may be more likely in hor- mone therapy nonusers. Observational studies generally support a reduced risk of colorectal cancer in current hormone therapy users compared with never users (HR, 0.6-0.8), with no benefit associated with past hormone therapy use.310-312 In observa- tional studies, both EPT and ET alone are associated with re- duced colorectal cancer risk313,314 and mortality.315 Although confounding may contribute to the reduced risk of colorectal can- cer seen in hormone therapy users, there is also biologic plausibil- ity, because estrogen receptors are present in colonic epithelium,316 and estrogen reduces colon cancer cell growth in vitro.317 In the WHI trials, use of CEE plus MPA, but not CEE alone, was associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer com- pared with placebo (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.89).9 Although EPT reduced the risk of colorectal cancer, the cancers that were detected in EPTusers were more likely to be d",

Key points • Observational studies suggest a reduced incidence of colo- rectal cancer in current hormone therapy users, with reduced mortality. (Level II) • In the WHI, EPT, but not ETalone, reduced colorectal cancer risk, although cancers diagnosed in EPTusers were diagnosed at a more advanced stage. There was no difference in colorec- tal cancer mortality with either EPT or ET. (Level I) LUNG CANCER Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the lead- ing cause of cancer death in US women.309 Smoking is the prin- cipal risk factor. An interaction between hormone therapy and lung cancer is biologically plausible because estrogen receptors (α and β) and aromatase are identified in both healthy lung tis- sue and lung cancers.319,320 Non-small cell lung cancer, includ- ing adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, is the most common type and the type affected by hormone therapy in ob- servational studies and RCTs. Observational studies, including several large meta-analyses, are conflicting and in aggregate identify no consistent association between hormone therapy use and lung cancer risk.321-327 Smoking may influence the as- sociation between hormone therapy use and lung cancer risk.326 For women with lung cancer, the effect of hormone therapy use o",

In the WHI, in the intervention phase or after a median of 13 years’ cumulative follow-up, the incidence of lung cancer did not differ significantly between placebo and treatment with CEE plus MPA or CEE alone.9 In a post hoc analysis of the intervention phase of the WHI, women treated with CEE plus MPA had more deaths from lung cancer compared with placebo (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.16-2.52).328 Cancers were more likely to be poorly differentiated, with distant metastasis. This increase in lung can- cer deaths was not seen with treatment with CEE alone329 and dissipated over time after stopping hormone therapy.330 Key points • There appears to be an overall neutral effect of hormone ther- apy on lung cancer incidence and survival. (Level II) • Smoking cessation should be encouraged, with increased lung cancer surveillance for older smokers, including current or past users of hormone therapy.

Because many women will experience bothersome VMS for many years, long-duration hormone therapy use may be needed, and an arbitrary age-based stopping rule is not clinically appro- priate. Frequent VMS persist on average 7.4 years and for many more than 10 years.59,331 In a study of Swedish women aged older than 85 years, 16% reported hot flashes at least several times per week,332 and up to 8% of women continue to have hot flashes for 20 years or longer after menopause.333 There are important questions related to long-duration hor- mone therapy use and discontinuation that are unanswered by NAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, Vol. 29, No. 7, 2022 783 available data, because the WHI, the longest adequately pow- ered blinded RCT, was limited to 5 to 7 years of therapy. In the WHI, initiating hormone therapy in women aged older than 60 years or more than 10 years beyond the onset of menopause was associated with greater risk, and initiating hormones in women aged older than 70 years was associated with the highest risk.9 It is not known whether women who initiate hormone therapy at the time of menopause and continue use at older ages will incur the same risks as women initiating hormones later in life. The WHI studied only one formulation of oral hormones (CEE with or without MPA). Observational data suggest lower CVD risk, including VTE and stroke, with other hormone formu- lations and routes of administration, including transdermal estra- diol, lower-dose estrogens, and different progestogens.25,251,334-336 Mitigation of risk through the appropriate choice of dosing, formu- lation, and route of administration becomes increasingly important as women age and with longer duration of therapy.",

Factors that should be considered include severity of symptoms, effective- ness of alternative nonhormone and lifestyle interventions, and underlying risk for osteoporosis, CHD, cerebrovascular ac- cident, VTE, and breast cancer. The decision regarding duration of treatment and when to stop hormone therapy must be consid- ered in the context of the individualized risk-benefit profile, as well as the woman’s personal preferences.337,338 Initiation after age 60 years Initiation of hormone therapy in women aged older than 60 years or more than 10 years from menopause onset has com- plex risks and requires careful consideration, recognizing that there may be well-counseled women aged older than 60 years who choose to initiate or restart hormone therapy. For women requesting to initiate hormone therapy because of VMS appear- ing many years after menopause onset, further evaluation is needed. Although new-onset VMS in an older woman could be caused by estrogen-deficiency, hot flashes or night sweats may be related to an underlying medical problem (eg, obstruc- tive sleep apnea, hyperthyroidism, carcinoid, lymphoma, Lyme disease, tuberculosis, HIV) or medication or substance use (eg, antidepressants, hypoglycemic agents, or withdrawal from alcohol or opioids).

The Beers criteria from the American Geriatrics Society339 has warnings against the use of hormone therapy in women aged older than 65 years. However, the recom- mendation to routinely discontinue systemic hormone therapy in women aged 65 years and older is neither cited or supported by evidence nor is it recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or The North American Meno- pause Society.340,341 Of note, the continued use of hormone therapy in healthy women aged older than 65 years at low risk for breast cancer and CVD is limited by insufficient evidence re- garding safety, risks, and benefits. For otherwise healthy women with persistent VMS, continu- ing hormone therapy beyond age 65 years is a reasonable option with appropriate counseling, regular assessment of risks and benefits, and shared decision-making. Hormone therapy also may be considered for prevention of fracture in healthy older women at elevated fracture risk when bothersome VMS persist or when hormone therapy remains the best choice because of lack of efficacy or intolerance of other fracture-prevention ther- apies.23,340 Long-duration hormone therapy use and use in older women is not appropriate for reduction in the risk of CHD or dementia.23,236,342 When providing hormone therapy to older women, clinicians must remain vigilant about risk stratifica- tion and potential mitigation strategies, such as switching from oral to transdermal hormone therapy, choice of progestogen, and lowering of dose.337,338 Discontinuation of hormone therapy Controversy exists regarding how long hormone therapy may safely be used and when it should be discontinued.

Based on findings from the WHI, breast cancer risk becomes detectable after 3 to 5 years in women using EPT. For women without a uterus using ET alone, breast cancer risk did not increase after 7 years, so a longer duration of hormone therapy use may be ac- ceptable. There are few studies to guide the optimal way for women to stop hormone therapy, and VMS will recur in approx- imately 50% of women after discontinuation.71 Data directly comparing the effects of abrupt discontinuation with those of slowly tapering are lacking,343 although clinical experts gener- ally advise gradually decreasing hormone therapy doses over time.338,343 If hormone therapy is being used for prevention of osteoporosis, it is important to remember that protection against bone density loss and fracture prevention is lost rapidly with dis- continuation.164 Although VMS generally improve with time, GSM worsens with prolonged estrogen deficiency, so women should be provided with treatment options on discontinuation of systemic hormone therapy. Observational studies confirm the long-term safety of low-dose vaginal ET,92,93 a highly effec- tive treatment for GSM. In the absence of contraindications, a woman should determine her preferred hormone therapy formu- lation, dose, and duration of use, with ongoing assessment and shared decision-making with her healthcare professional.337,338 Key points • The safety profile of hormone therapy is most favorable when initiated in healthy women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, so initiation of hor- mone therapy by menopausal women aged older than 60 years requires careful consideration of individual benefits and risks.",

(Level III) • In the absence of contraindications, a woman should determine her preferred hormone therapy formulation, dose, and duration of use, with ongoing assessment and shared decision-making with her healthcare professional. (Level III) SUMMARY Hormone therapy formulation, dose, regimen, route of admin- istration, and the timing of initiation of therapy likely produce dif- ferent effects, although these have yet to be evaluated in head-to- head RCTs. There is a significant difference in the benefits and risks of ET alone compared with EPT. Decision-making sur- rounding the use of hormone therapy should be individualized, with recommendations for the use of the appropriate dose, dura- tion, regimen, and route of administration required to manage a woman’s symptoms and to meet treatment goals. Given the more favorable safety profile of ET alone, longer durations may be more appropriate. Risk stratification by age and time since men- opause is recommended. Transdermal routes of administration and lower doses of hormone therapy may decrease risk of VTE and stroke; however, comparative RCT data are lacking. Personalization with shared decision-making remains key, with periodic reevaluation to determine an individual woman’s benefit-risk profile. Benefits may include relief of bothersome VMS, prevention of bone loss and reduction of fracture, treat- ment of GSM, and improved sleep, well-being, and quality of life. Absolute attributable risks for women in the 50- to 59-year-old age group or within 10 years of menopause onset are low, whereas the risks of initiation of hormone therapy for women aged 60 years and older or who are further than 10 years from menopause onset appear greater, particularly for those aged 70 years and older or more than 20 years from menopause onset, with more research needed on potential risks of longer durations of use.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] f initiation of hormone therapy for women aged 60 years and older or who are further than 10 years from menopause onset appear greater, particularly for those aged 70 years and older or more than 20 years from menopause onset, with more research needed on potential risks of longer durations of use. Women with POI and premature or early menopause have higher risks of bone loss, heart disease, and cognitive or affec- tive disorders associated with estrogen deficiency. In observa- tional studies, these risks appear to be mitigated if ET is given until the average age of menopause, at which time treatment de- cisions should be reevaluated. In limited observational studies, women who are BRCA-positive and have undergone risk-reducing BO appear to receive similar benefits from receiving hormone therapy, with minimal to no increased risk of breast cancer. There is a paucity of RCT data about the risks of extended duration of hormone therapy in women aged older than 60 or 65 years, al- though observational studies suggest a potential rare risk of breast cancer with increased duration of hormone therapy. It remains an individual decision in select, well-counseled women aged older than 60 or 65 years to continue therapy. There are no data to sup- port routine discontinuation in women aged 65 years. For select survivors of breast and endometrial cancer, obser- vational data show that use of low-dose vaginal ET for those who fail nonhormone therapy for treatment of GSM appears safe and greatly improves quality of life for many. The use of systemic hormone therapy needs careful consideration for survi- vors of estrogen-sensitive cancers and should only be used for compelling reasons in collaboration with a woman’s oncologist after failure of nonhormone therapies. Additional research is needed on the thrombotic risk (VTE, pulmonary embolism, and stroke) of oral versus transdermal therapies (including different formulations, doses, and durations of therapy).",
    "[INTRODUCTION] r compelling reasons in collaboration with a woman’s oncologist after failure of nonhormone therapies. Additional research is needed on the thrombotic risk (VTE, pulmonary embolism, and stroke) of oral versus transdermal therapies (including different formulations, doses, and durations of therapy). More clinical trial data are needed to confirm or re- fute the potential beneficial effects of hormone therapy on CHD and all-cause mortality when initiated in perimenopause or early postmenopause. Additional areas for research include the breast effects of different estrogen preparations, including the role for SERM and TSEC therapies; optimal progestogen or SERM reg- imens to prevent endometrial hyperplasia; the relationship be- tween VMS and the risk for heart disease and cognitive changes; and the risks of POI. Studies are needed on the effects of longer use of low-dose vaginal ET after breast or endometrial cancer; extended use of hormone therapy in women who are early initi- ators; improved tools to personalize or individualize benefits and risks of hormone therapy; the role of aging and genetics; and the long-term benefits and risks on women’s health of life- style modification or complementary or nonhormone therapies if chosen in addition to or over hormone therapy for VMS, bone health, and CVD risk reduction. CONCLUSIONS • Hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for VMS and GSM and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. • Risks of hormone therapy differ for women, depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is needed. Treatment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] f hormone therapy differ for women, depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is needed. Treatment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation. • For women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset and without contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio appears favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for the prevention of bone loss and reduction of fracture. Based on the WHI RCTs, longer duration may be more favorable for ET than for EPT. • For women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or when aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable than for younger women because of greater absolute risks of CHD, stroke, VTE, and dementia. • For GSM symptoms not relieved with nonhormone therapies, low-dose vaginal ET or other government-approved therapies (eg, vaginal DHEA or oral ospemifene) are recommended.

    "[INTRODUCTION] NAMS POSITION STATEMENT The 2023 nonhormone therapy position statement of The North American Menopause Society Abstract Objective: To update the evidence-based Nonhormonal Management of Menopause-Associated Vasomotor Symp- toms: 2015 Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society. Methods: An advisory panel of clinicians and research experts in women’s health were selected to review and evaluate the literature published since the Nonhormonal Management of Menopause-Associated Vasomotor Symptoms: 2015 Po- sition Statement of The North American Menopause Society. Topics were divided into five sections for ease of review: lifestyle; mind-body techniques; prescription therapies; dietary supplements; and acupuncture, other treatments, and technologies. The panel assessed the most current and available literature to determine whether to recommend or not recommend use based on these levels of evidence: Level I, good and consistent scientific evidence; Level II, limited or inconsistent scientific evidence, and Level III, consensus and expert opinion. Results: Evidence-based review of the literature resulted in several nonhormone options for the treatment of vasomo- tor symptoms. Recommended: Cognitive-behavioral therapy, clinical hypnosis, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors/ serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin, fezolinetant (Level I); oxybutynin (Levels I-II); weight loss, stellate ganglion block (Levels II-III). Not recommended: Paced respiration (Level I); supplements/herbal remedies (Levels I-II); cooling techniques, avoiding triggers, exercise, yoga, mindfulness-based intervention, relaxation, suvorexant, soy foods and soy extracts, soy metabolite equol, cannabinoids, acupuncture, calibration of neural oscilla- tions (Level II); chiropractic interventions, clonidine; (Levels I-III); dietary modification and pregabalin (Level III).",

Conclusion: Hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and should be consid- ered in menopausal women within 10 years of their final menstrual periods. For women who are not good candidates for hormone therapy because of contraindications (eg, estrogen-dependent cancers or cardiovascular disease) or personal preference, it is important for healthcare professionals to be well informed about nonhormone treatment options for re- ducing vasomotor symptoms that are supported by the evidence. Key Words: Clinical hypnosis – Cognitive-behavioral therapy – Gabapentin – Hormone therapy – Menopause – Nonhormone therapy – Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors – Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors – Stellate ganglion block – Vasomotor symptoms. H ot flashes and night sweats (vasomotor symptoms [VMS]) are the most common symptoms of menopause and oc- cur in up to 80% of menopausal women.1 Vasomotor symptoms can be bothersome, lasting a mean duration of 7 to 9 years, and in one-third of women, can last more than 10 years.2 Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment and should be considered in menopausal women aged younger than 60 years, within 10 years of their final menstrual periods, and without contraindications. Despite this, the use of HT has de- clined substantially after the publication of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI).3-5 Evidence suggests that contrary to guideline recommendations, younger women and those with more VMS were less likely to receive HTafter the WHI than before.6 Addi- tionally, rates of continuation of HT have declined in women with more frequent VMS after the WHI, largely because of me- dia reports",
    "[INTRODUCTION] 5 Evidence suggests that contrary to guideline recommendations, younger women and those with more VMS were less likely to receive HTafter the WHI than before.6 Addi- tionally, rates of continuation of HT have declined in women with more frequent VMS after the WHI, largely because of me- dia reports and provider advice. Despite the underuse of HT in symptomatic women, some may choose not to use HT or have contraindications to its use, such as a history of an estrogen-sensitive cancer (including breast cancer), coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, Received March 21, 2023; revised and accepted March 21, 2023.

This Position Statement updates and expands information on the nonhormone management of VMS from the 2015 NAMS Position Statement on nonhormone therapies and is intended to provide direction to guide evidence-based nonhormone man- agement of VMS. METHODS An advisory panel of clinicians and research experts in the field of women’s health was selected to review and evaluate the literature published after the Nonhormonal Management of Menopause-Associated Vasomotor Symptoms: 2015 Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society. Topics were divided into five sections for ease of review: life- style; mind-body techniques; prescription therapies; dietary supplements; and acupuncture, other treatments, and technolo- gies. Individual panel members reviewed and evaluated the evidence on the different therapies for which they had special expertise, with the knowledge that trials of nonhormone treat- ments of VMS have a placebo improvement rate of 20% to 66%, and women with more anxiety show higher response to placebo.8 The 2023 Nonhormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society was written after an exten- sive review of the pertinent literature and includes key points identified during the review process. The resulting manuscript was submitted to and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. The panel assessed the most current and available literature to recommend or not recommend use with the level of evidence assigned on the basis of these categories: • Level I: Good and consistent scientific evidence. • Level II: Limited or inconsistent scientific evidence. • Level III: Consensus and expert opinion.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] d the most current and available literature to recommend or not recommend use with the level of evidence assigned on the basis of these categories: • Level I: Good and consistent scientific evidence. • Level II: Limited or inconsistent scientific evidence. • Level III: Consensus and expert opinion. This Position Statement uses gender-specific language as reflected in the referenced publications. However, NAMS recog- nizes that some persons experiencing menopause may identify differently than with the gender and pronouns used in this statement. LIFESTYLE Cooling techniques Hot flashes can be triggered by small, core-body-temperature elevations9-11; therefore, it is feasible that changing lifestyle practices that control core body temperature may decrease VMS frequency. These include clothing adjustments (ie, dress- ing in layers; wearing sleeveless blouses; using breathable cloth- ing materials; avoiding pullover sweaters, tops, and scarves) and environmental controls (hand or electric fans; cold packs under the pillow; turning the pillow when feeling warm; dual control electric blankets or a bed fan; lower room temperature). One small (N = 20), uncontrolled trial of postmenopausal women showed benefits with the use of a forehead cooling device and sleep hygiene instructions for reduction in self-reports of sleep problems and VMS over a 4-week period.12 Another small trial (N = 39) of a nighttime thermal comfort intervention was stud- ied in a 4-week randomized, crossover trial.13 Women reported no objective changes in the number or duration of nighttime VMS with this device, despite some self-reported improvements in sleep compared with baseline (ie, no device). Overall, cooling interventions must be tested in larger randomized, placebo-/ sham-controlled clinical trials for the treatment of VMS.

(Level II; not recommended) Avoiding triggers Women are often told to avoid “triggers” such as alcohol, caf- feine, spicy foods, or hot foods or liquids. One cross-sectional study of 4,595 Chinese women found a positive association be- tween alcohol intake and VMS14; however, this has not been re- ported in other studies (such as the Melbourne Women’s Midlife Health Project).15 There are no clinical trials assessing the ef- fects of avoiding triggers for the alleviation of VMS. (Level II; not recommended) Exercise and yoga Observational studies revealed that women who exercise reg- ularly report fewer VMS.16-18 However, others have found no relationship between level of physical activity or exercise and VMS,19 and exercise may trigger VMS in symptomatic women.10 Several Cochrane reviews concluded that there was insufficient or poor evidence to consider exercise as a treatment for VMS.20-22 Among the challenges, methods and exercise in- terventions varied widely across studies. They included, for ex- ample, supervised walking versus yoga versus no intervention23 and supervised aerobic exercise versus yoga versus usual activ- ity plus omega-3 or placebo pills.24 No difference was found be- tween yoga and exercise. When study results comparing exer- cise to no exercise were pooled, exercise had no effect on VMS frequency.22 One study in the Cochrane review comparing exercise and HT found that HTwas far more effective than exer- cise in reducing VMS. A pooled analysis of individual data from four MsFLASH tri- als (N = 1,005) assessed various interventions compared with placebo for the treatment of VMS, including estradiol, antide- pressants, omega-3, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for in- somnia, and yoga or aerobic exercise.25 Women with more both- ersome VMS benefited the most from estradiol, whereas those with VMS and i",

Those with VMS and psychosocial complaints reported im- provement with antidepressants or CBT for insomnia. Overall, exercise and yoga led to smaller improvements and were not rec- ommended as single interventions for VMS. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs; N = 1,306) assessed yoga against no treatment, health education, exercise, and auricular acupressure for the treatment of VMS.26 Given that all outcomes were self-reported and that there was insufficient blinding of partici- pants, there was a high risk for reporting and detection bias among the studies. Additionally, there was significant heteroge- neity in yoga styles, intensity, and frequency, limiting the inter- pretability of the findings. Yoga had limited benefits compared NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 574 Menopause, Vol. 30, No. 6, 2023 © 2023 by The North American Menopause Society with exercise for the treatment of VMS, and there were no ben- efits compared with no treatment. Although there are other health benefits associated with exer- cise or yoga, the evidence of those interventions for the treat- ment of VMS is sparse. (Level II; not recommended) Dietary modification Research evaluating the relationship of diet and VMS is lim- ited. A study in postmenopausal women with more than two VMS per day (N = 84) randomized to a low-fat, plant-based diet and a half-cup of cooked soybeans per day versus no dietary changes found an 88% reduction in moderate to severe VMS compared with a 34% reduction in those with no dietary changes after 12 weeks.27 In surveys, more vegetable and fruit consumption was associated with fewer menopause symp",
    "[INTRODUCTION] t-based diet and a half-cup of cooked soybeans per day versus no dietary changes found an 88% reduction in moderate to severe VMS compared with a 34% reduction in those with no dietary changes after 12 weeks.27 In surveys, more vegetable and fruit consumption was associated with fewer menopause symp- toms,28 and women who followed a vegan diet reported fewer bothersome VMS than those who ate meat. For both, increased vegetable consumption was associated with fewer bothersome symptoms.29 One longitudinal cohort study showed high-fat and -sugar diets were associated with an increased risk of VMS.30 One study found that women who had higher soy milk and vegetable consumption had fewer menopause symptoms, whereas those who ate poultry and skimmed dairy products had worse menopause symptoms overall, including more VMS.31 There is limited evidence from clinical trials to support the use of dietary modification for improving VMS. (Level III; not recommended) Weight loss Studies have found that women who are obese are more likely to report more frequent and severe hot flashes than women of normal weight.32 Randomized, controlled trials have found that weight loss from behavioral interventions are associated with a decrease in VMS.33,34 Additionally, reducing hot flashes was a major motivator for losing weight.33 Evidence suggests that the role of adiposity and weight loss in VMS may vary depending on age or menopause stage and specifically that adiposity acts as a risk factor for VMS earlier in the transition (perimenopause and early postmenopause)35 but not when women are older or later in the transition.36 Weight loss may have greater effects in reducing VMS when women are earlier in the transition.33 In an open-label single-arm pilot study of a weight-loss medica- tion (selective serotonin 2C [5-HT2C] receptor agonist) tested in 20 women, after 12-weeks there were both a decrease in weight and significant improvement in VMS (decline, 5.4 hot flashes/d) from baseline to w",
    "[INTRODUCTION] ier in the transition.33 In an open-label single-arm pilot study of a weight-loss medica- tion (selective serotonin 2C [5-HT2C] receptor agonist) tested in 20 women, after 12-weeks there were both a decrease in weight and significant improvement in VMS (decline, 5.4 hot flashes/d) from baseline to week 12.37 The study also found that after the weight-loss medication was stopped, there was a rapid increase in VMS with a return to baseline weight, further supporting the notion that weight loss improved VMS. How- ever, these studies are either small pilot studies, nonran- domized trials, or post hoc analyses of studies designed for a different purpose. Larger, rigorously designed RCTs are needed. The limited available evidence suggests that weight loss may be used to improve VMS for some women. (Levels II-III; recommended) Key points • There is no strong evidence that lifestyle changes such as cooling techniques and avoiding triggers improve VMS. • There is insufficient or poor evidence to consider exercise or yoga as a treatment for VMS. • A healthy diet is important for health promotion and chronic disease prevention; however, there is limited evidence to sup- port dietary modifications as a tool for improving VMS. • Weight loss may be considered for improving VMS. MIND-BODY TECHNIQUES Cognitive-behavioral therapy Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to re- duce the degree to which VMS are rated as a problem. Initial ev- idence came from two double-blind RCTs: MENOS 1, which showed that group CBT compared with usual care reduced VMS problem ratings in 96 survivors of breast cancer,38 and MENOS 2, which showed self-guided and group CBT com- pared with usual care reduced VMS problem ratings in 140 peri- menopausal and postmenopausal women without a history of breast cancer.39 A clinical psychologist administered the group CBT interven- tion, which involved psychoeducation (physiology of VMS; how thoughts and emotions affect the perception of physical sensa",

The content of the self-guided CBT was identical to that of the group CBT and included a self-help book completed during a 4-week pe- riod, two contacts with a clinical psychologist, weekly home- work, and a compact disc for daily practice of relaxation and paced breathing. The usual-care group received information about VMS, ad- vice on treatment options and symptom management, and in- structions for paced breathing and relaxation. In both studies, improvements in VMS problem ratings were maintained at 26 weeks, and more women in the CBT group (65%-78% across studies) reached a clinically significant threshold for improve- ment in VMS that are rated as a problem than in the usual-care group. Beliefs about coping and control over VMS and beliefs about sleep and night sweats mediated the effect of CBT on VMS problem ratings.40 Since these initial trials, several studies have extended this in- tervention to other modes of delivery and in other populations. Two studies in survivors of breast cancer showed that CBT re- duced 1) VMS rated as a problem, hot flash interference, and self-reported VMS frequency when delivered by trained nurses in MENOS 4 (N = 130),41 or 2) VMS rated as a problem and self-reported VMS frequency when delivered via the internet (with or without therapist support; N = 254).42 Aworkplace study of 124 menopausal women with problem- atic VMS found that women who received CBT for VMS using a self-help book had significant reducti",

A caveat to this body of work is that the studies largely employ waitlist or usual-care controls, which are less rigorous controls than active controls matched on time and at- tention. However, the body of literature as a whole supports that CBT alleviates bothersome VMS for both survivors of breast cancer and menopausal women. (Level I; recommended) Mindfulness-based interventions Evidence is limited for mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) for the management of VMS. Common features of MBI in- clude instruction in meditation practices and how to approach thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations in an accepting, nonjudg- mental manner.

Awidely disseminated MBI is mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a multicomponent intervention that includes mindfulness meditation, body awareness, and yoga.46 An RCT of MBSR versus waitlist control was conducted in 110 women who had five or more moderate to severe hot flashes per day. The MBSR intervention was a standardized, widely used, 8-week program involving weekly 2.5-hour group classes, at-home practice (45 min, 6 d/wk), and an 8-hour in-person group retreat. Vasomotor symptoms were assessed via a diary. After 20 weeks, the MBSR group showed greater reductions in hot flash bother (21.62% vs 10.50%; P = .07) and intensity (44.56% vs 26.97%; P = .057) than waitlist controls; these differences were marginally significant, reflecting the pilot nature of the study, variability in the outcome, and pronounced placebo effect. Several additional studies have examined MBSR or other MBI for a constellation of menopause symptoms (eg, VMS, anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance) in women transitioning through menopause47,48 who were survivors of breast cancer49 or who had undergone early bilateral oophorec- tomy.50 A meta-analysis similarly examined MBI for quality of life or general menopause symptoms.51 These studies have gen- erally shown positive effects in reducing menopause symptoms broadly, with mixed effects for VMS specifically. Given that these studies were limited by their small sizes or limited control groups and that they were not designed to consider VMS (eg, women with VMS were not specifically enrolled), there are not enough data to recommend MBSR for the management of VMS. Future rigorously designed trials are needed to test the efficacy of MBI for VMS.

(Level II; not recommended) Clinical hypnosis Clinical hypnosis is a mind-body therapy that involves a deeply relaxed state and individualized mental imagery and sug- gestion. It has been widely used to manage other chronic symp- toms such as pain and anxiety. Hypnosis has been studied for the treatment of hot flashes in two trials—one randomized trial in survivors of breast cancer52 and one RCT in women with at least seven hot flashes per day.53 In both trials, clinical hypnosis involved 5 weekly in-person sessions of hypnotherapy with at-home self-hypnosis practice. In a study of 60 women with a history of breast cancer, clinical hypnosis was significantly bet- ter at reducing hot flashes and improving mood and sleep than no treatment.52 A 2013 single-blind RCT of 187 postmenopausal women reporting at least 50 hot flashes aweek at baseline evaluated clin- ical hypnosis over 12 weeks against an active structured-attention control.53 Both clinical hypnosis and structured-attention con- trol included 5 weekly sessions that included discussion of symptoms, attentive listening, interpersonal exchange, avoid- ance of negative suggestions, monitoring, measurement, and en- couragement provided in a therapeutic environment with a trained clinician. The hypnosis group additionally received hyp- notic inductions and cooling suggestions. Participants in the clinical-hypnosis arm reported significantly lower hot flash fre- quency (74% vs 17%; P < .001) and hot flash scores (frequency times severity, 80% vs 15%; P < .001) than controls. In addition, physiologically monitored hot flashes were reduced signifi- cantly more in the hypnosis group than in the attention-control group (57% vs 10%; P < .001), indicating a clinically signifi- cant improvement.",

A follow-up analysis showed that effects were not related to women’s expectations about whether hypno- sis would work.54 The program can be delivered via a trained provider or accessed via a smartphone application. (Level I; recommended) Paced respiration Paced respiration is unlikely to provide any benefit for hot flashes. Paced respiration involves taking six to eight slow, deep breaths per minute while inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth. Paced respiration was shown to reduce hot flashes in several small studies that were done in a behavioral laboratory.55-57 Two larger studies did not show any benefits over other forms of breathing. In a randomized trial of 208 women, paced respiration was no better than shallow breathing or usual care for reducing hot flash frequency, severity, bother, or inter- ference.58 Similarly, in a randomized trial of 92 women, paced respiration practiced once or twice per day was no better than usual breathing for reducing hot flash scores (frequency times severity).59 A third study showed that women who used a chest device to guide their slow, deep breathing practice at home for at least 15 minutes per day had significantly less benefit than a control group assigned to music listening.60 (Level I; not recommended) Relaxation Evidence is limited and inconsistent on relaxation for hot flashes.

Of 46 women randomized in a 1:1 fashion, 66% dropped out early (no reasons provided), and the study had to be terminated. Limitations across studies included small sample sizes or lack of an appropriate attention-control group.55,56,63,65-68 (Level II; not recommended) Key points • CBT has been shown to reduce the bother and interference associated with VMS. • Clinical hypnosis has been shown to reduce VMS frequency and severity. • MBSR interventions for the management of VMS are limited by sample size and lack of control groups and are not de- signed to consider VMS; therefore, there are not enough data to recommend treatment. • Paced breathing and relaxation techniques do not alleviate VMS and are not recommended. PRESCRIPTION THERAPIES Many nonhormone prescription therapies have been evaluated and found to significantly reduce VMS in symptomatic meno- pausal women. However, there are only two FDA approved for this indication: paroxetine mesylate 7.5 mg daily and fezolinetant 45 mg daily.

Other medications that reduce VMS include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentin, and oxybutynin. Typically, the onset of action is within 2 weeks. There are limited trials comparing nonhormone prescription therapies head-to-head with hormone therapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors Evidence exists that SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with mild to moderate improvements in VMS, regardless of whether meno- pause is natural or surgical, as supported by meta-analyses,69-71 a pooled analysis,72 a Cochrane review,73 and a review focused on evidence in survivors of cancer.74 Limitations to these reviews in- clude heterogeneity of the populations and variations in inclusion criteria, as well as variability in the population that was tested, dosing, length of treatment, and outcomes evaluated. Paroxetine,75 escitalopram,76 citalopram,77 venlafaxine,78,79 and desvenlafaxine80 have been shown to significantly reduce VMS in large, double-blind RCTs of symptomatic women. Duloxetine has been found to reduce VMS in smaller studies.81,82 Hot flash reduc- tions vary from 25% to 69% with these treatments, with im- provements in composite hot flash severity and frequency from 27% to 61%. Trends toward improvement have been seen with sertraline and fluoxetine, but these were statistically insignifi- cant; therefore, they are not recommended.69,79,83-86 A pooled analysis from three RCTs showed that 10 mg to 20 mg of escitalopram, 0.5 mg of oral 17β-estradiol, and 75 mg of venlafaxine daily resulted in comparable reductions in VMS frequency.",

A trial reported that 75 mg per day of venlafaxine was similar to low-dose oral estradiol 0.5 mg per day.79,87 Oral estradiol reduced the frequency of hot flashes by 2.3 more per day than placebo ( P < .001), whereas venlafaxine reduced the frequency of hot flashes by 1.8 more per day than placebo (P = .005). However, neither of these tri- als allowed dose escalation, in which case estradiol would be expected to provide 77% improvement in hot flashes on average.88 A low-dose paroxetine salt (7.5 mg/d) was the first nonhormone pharmaceutical FDA approved for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS, with improvements found in VMS severity and frequency for up to 24 months, along with improvements in sleep disruption, without weight gain or nega- tive effects on libido.89,90 Prior neuroleptic syndrome, serotonin syndrome, and concur- rent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors are contraindications to SSRIs and SNRIs. Caution should be taken in prescribing in patients with uncontrolled seizures, bipolar disorder, kidney or liver insufficiency, uncontrolled hyponatremia, and poorly controlled hypertension, as well as concurrent use of other SSRIs or SNRIs and pertinent polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 enzyme pathways. Black box warnings include uncom- mon suicidal thoughts in adolescents and children within the first few months.

Coadministration of SSRIs may lead to inhibition of CYP2D6 (the enzyme that converts tamoxifen to its most active metabolite, endoxifen) in women using tamoxifen, particularly with paroxetine and fluoxetine. Safer choices for those on ta- moxifen include venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, escitalopram, or citalopram because they have less of an effect on the CYP2D6 enzyme. There is a possible reported risk of bone fracture with SSRIs because serotonin alters signaling on bone metabo- lism,91,92 although this has not been seen with short-term use.93 They may produce nausea or dizziness, which typically improves after 1 to 2 weeks. (Level I; recommended) Gabapentinoids Gabapentin is FDA approved as an antiepileptic drug that is commonly used to treat diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. However, several trials studying the dose of 900 mg (300 mg three times/d) show that this has improved the fre- quency and severity of VMS.94-96 Possible adverse events (AEs) include dizziness, unsteadiness, and drowsiness, typi- cally seen during the first week, with improvement during the second week and resolution by week 4. In a placebo-controlled trial, higher doses of gabapentin (titrated to 2,400 mg/d) were as beneficial as estrogen (conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg/d) in reducing hot flash severity scores.97 Adverse events of gabapentin at this dose included dizziness, headache, and dis- orientation, which limited its potential benefits. Because drows- iness is an AE, and the half-life is short, bedtime dosing of gabapentin may be a good choice for women with disruptive sleep from VMS. Black box warnings for all antiepileptic agents, including gabapentin, include uncommon suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Adverse events include drowsiness, dizziness, and impaired balance or coordination. The suggested dosing (for gabapentin is 900 mg to 2,400 mg per day in divided doses.",

There has been one phase 3 RCT in 163 women (40% with a history of cancer) evaluating pregabalin for VMS.98 After 6 weeks of treatment, pregabalin at a dose of 75 mg twice a day or 150 mg twice a day decreased VMS frequency by 59% and 61%, respectively, whereas pla- cebo decreased symptoms by 35%. There were more dizziness and cognitive difficulties reported in those taking pregabalin. Because of limited studies, AEs, including weight gain, and be- cause pregabalin is listed as a Schedule V controlled substance (because of the potential for abuse), pregabalin is not recom- mended. (Level III; not recommended) Clonidine Clonidine is a centrally active α-2 adrenergic agonist that has been shown to be modestly more beneficial than placebo69 but less beneficial than SSRIs, SNRIs, and gabapentin in reducing VMS.69,73 It is used infrequently because of AEs, including hy- potension, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, dizziness, se- dation, and constipation. Sudden cessation can lead to significant elevations in blood pressure. Because there are other more effec- tive therapies with fewer AEs, clonidine is not recommended.

One prospective study99 and two randomized, double-blind studies100,101 in postmenopausal women demon- strated that oxybutynin at doses ranging from 2.5 mg or 5 mg twice daily up to 15 mg extended-release daily significantly im- proved moderate to severe VMS. Adverse events of oxybutynin are usually dose-dependent and most commonly include a dry mouth and urinary difficulties. Long-term use of anticholiner- gics may be associated with cognitive decline, particularly in older persons.102-104 (Levels I-II; recommended) Suvorexant Suvorexant is a dual orexin-receptor antagonist that blocks the effects of the hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin-A, which promotes wakefulness and may be involved in the occurrences of hot flashes. Postmenopausal women have plasma levels that are three times higher than premenopausal women, which may contribute to sleep disruption and impaired thermoregulation.105 Suvorexant has been shown to reduce insomnia severity,106-108 and findings in a small study of menopausalwomen showed that it led to reductions in nighttime VMS frequency compared with placebo and was well tolerated.109 Suvorexant did not improve daytime VMS.

(Level II; not recommended) Neurokinin B antagonists New nonhormone therapies, only one of which (fezolinetant) is FDA approved, are important because their development was founded on the burgeoning understanding of VMS physiology. It is recognized that pulsatile gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion is itself driven by an ensemble of pacemaker cells that produce kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin, leading to the coined acronym KNDy (pronounced candy) to de- scribe this unique subset of hypothalamic neurons. These KNDy neurons are surrounded by a dense plexus of intercon- nected fibers to ensure that all KNDy neurons fire in concert and together constitute the GnRH pulse generator.110 Neurokinin B stimulates and dynorphin inhibits sustained pul- satile kisspeptin secretion. In turn, kisspeptin acts directly on GnRH neurons to stimulate GnRH secretion, thereby driving lu- teinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) release. In parallel with the effect of KNDy neurons on GnRH in the hypothalamus, the KNDy neuronal plexus has direct effects on the adjacent hypothalamic thermoregulatory center.111 After declines in circulating levels of estradiol across the menopause transition, VMS are triggered by hyperactivity of the KNDy neu- ron plexus, resulting in hypersecretion of neurokinin B.112 Hyper- secretion of neurokinin B from the KNDy neurons onto the adja- cent thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus111 causes dis- ruption of temperature control and the occurrence of VMS.112,113 Therapeutic development of neurokinin B antagonists was initi- ated as a novel strategy to target VMS.

Higher doses appear to suppress LH but not estradiol in postmenopausal women with VMS.114 However, potentially advantageous and detrimental effects on other physiologic processes have yet to be fully investigated in larger populations. Key points • SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with mild to moderate im- provements in VMS. • Gabapentin is associated with improvements in the frequency and severity of VMS. • Pregabalin is not recommended for VMS because of AEs and controlled-substance prescribing restrictions. • Because of significant AEs and no recent studies showing greater benefit than placebo, clonidine is not recommended. • Oxybutynin has been shown to reduce moderate to severe VMS, although in older adults, long-term use may be associ- ated with cognitive decline. • Given limited data, suvorexant is not recommended. • Fezolinetant is a first-in-class neurokinin B antagonist that is FDA approved for management of vasomotor symptoms.

DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS Managing VMS with dietary supplements is complex and challenging because there are limited rigorous randomized, clin- ical trial data from which to evaluate supplements and a lack of government regulation to ensure their purity and safety. These over-the-counter products remain widely marketed through direct-to-consumer marketing. They are permitted to market to- ward specific claims of alleviating symptoms despite limited ev- idence as long as there is no claim to provide disease benefit. Dietary supplements with limited or inconsistent evidence of benefit Soy foods and soy extracts Soy is the most widely used isoflavone-containing food. Isoflavones are a class of phytochemicals, a broad group of nonsteroidal compounds of diverse structure that bind to estro- gen receptors (ERs) in animals and human beings. Isoflavones have a greater affinity for ER-β than for ER-α and possess both estrogen-agonist and estrogen-antagonist properties.124 Soy is among the eight most common food allergens,125 and reactions can range from mild (eg, bloating, flatulence, loose stools) to severe (eg, anaphylaxis). “The Nonhormonal Management of Menopause-Associated Vasomotor Symptoms: 2015 Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society” noted mixed evidence for use of soy for VMS.126 Soy trials published since 2015 are difficult to summarize because of the wide variation in interventions tested (eg, soy-based drinks,127,128 soy isoflavone derivatives in tablets only129 or combined with exercise,130 or mixed with other supplements [herbals, vitamins, or minerals]), with widely varying dosages tested.131-135 These studies also have signifi- cant limitations, including small sample sizes,129-131,133,134 use of symptom checklists126-131,133,135 rather than VMS di- aries,134 and relatively short-term assessment of outcomes.",

For example, most participants reported VMS after 12 weeks of treatment,127-129,131,133-135 yet meta-analyses suggest more than 13 weeks are needed to demonstrate half of the expected maximal effects,136 and more than 16 weeks are needed for optimal ef- fects.137 As a result of these study differences and limitations, the findings are mixed, with some studies showing soy to be beneficial for reducing VMS or severity,131,132,135 and others showing no benefit of soy over placebo127,128,130,133 or finding soy to be less beneficial than other treatments.129 (Level II; not recommended) Soy metabolite equol Equol is a nonsteroidal estrogen that binds to ER-α and ER-β, but because of its high affinity for ER-β, it is often designated as an ER-β agonist. Few studies have considered whether study participants can metabolize soy, which is critical for soy’s poten- tial estrogenic effects. Only 35% of North American women can metabolize the soy isoflavone daidzein to equol.138 Women who are able to metabolize soy into equol would be expected to expe- rience relief from VMS with soy products or equol. Women who cannot produce equol after ingesting soy do not benefit from soy but would be expected to benefit from equol. Tests to ascertain whether women are equol producers are not commercially avail- able to the public or healthcare professionals. A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis found positive effects of equol supplementation over placebo for reducing VMS frequency in three of five trials.139 Null findings in the re- maining two trials were hypothesized to have been because of large differences in VMS at baseline in one trial and inclusion of only equol-producing women in th",

A limitation in most studies (4 of the 6) was inclusion of fewer than 50 par- ticipants per group. There is currently mixed evidence for soy foods, soy extracts, and the soy metabolite equol from widely diverse studies, with some significant limitations.

Both studies showed im- provement in menopause symptoms such as sleep, fatigue, loss of interest in sex, joint and muscle pain, VMS, and a decrease in anxiety compared with the placebo group. Women in the ammo- nium succinate-supplement group also showed an increase in serum estradiol levels and a decrease in leptin. The authors con- cluded that the pooled analysis of the two studies found that the ammonium succinate-based supplement improved meno- pause symptoms, including VMS, compared with placebo. Because of limited studies and the results being based on manufacturer-sponsored clinical trials, ammonium succinate is not recommended. (Level II; not recommended) Lactobacillus acidophilus Lactobacillus acidophilus YT1 was studied for managing menopause symptoms.145 One 12-week, multicenter, double blind, RCTl (N = 67) involved women with menopause symp- toms including VMS. After 12 weeks, total Kupperman Index (KI) scores decreased, and quality of life was improved (Menopause-Specific Quality of Life [MSQOL] questionnaire) in all four symptom domains (physical, psychological, vasomotor, and sexual). There were no reported changes in hormone levels or endometrial lining. Given that this data is limited to one small study, based on global menopause symptom ratings, and has not been replicated, it is not recommended at this time.

(Level II; not recommended) Rhubarb Siberian rhubarb (Rheum rhaponticum) is used as a food and as a medicinal plant for constipation, diarrhea, and other gastroin- testinal complaints. A single commercial preparation of rhubarb extract, which has been used in Germany for more than 20 years, was introduced in the United States (Estrovera). The product con- tains a proprietary extract called rhaponticin or extract ERr 731 and contains estrogenic properties but is not estrogen. One study randomized 109 symptomatic perimenopausal women to ERr 731 (n = 54) or placebo (n = 55) daily for 12 weeks.146 Only 7 of 55 women randomized to placebo completed the trial (12.7% retention rate), and 39 of 54 women randomized to active treatment completed the trial. The researchers reported that at 12 weeks, the MRS total score and each symptom within the scale (including VMS) significantly improved in the active-treatment group versus placebo. Human safety data were drawn from a group of 23 women followed for 48 weeks, 20 of whom com- pleted a 96-week observation period. Few AEs were reported.147 Another open-label, single-arm study in Indian perimenopausal women over 12 weeks reported improved menopause symp- toms.148 Given the extremely low retention rate in clinical trials and the open-label study design in one study, the conclusions are limited.

    "[INTRODUCTION] ithout demonstrated evidence of benefit Black cohosh Black cohosh, scientific name Actaea racemosa L. (previ- ously Cimicifugae racemosae), is the most purchased botanical for menopause symptoms. The active ingredients in black co- hosh extract are unknown, and its mechanism of action is un- clear. At one time it was thought to be estrogenic, with in vitro and in vivo assays indicating estrogen-like activity.149 Other studies indicate activity similar to selective estrogen-receptor modulators150 or modulation of serotonergic pathways, as well as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Reports of possible hepatotoxicity started to appear after 2000. After examining all reported cases, the US Pharmacope- ial Convention Dietary Supplements-Botanicals Expert Com- mittee found 30 reports possibly related to black cohosh. The committee issued a directive that black cohosh products carry a warning statement: “Discontinue use and consult a health- care practitioner if you have a liver disorder or develop symp- toms of liver trouble, such as abdominal pain, dark urine, or jaundice.”151 A 2012 Cochrane review152 analyzed 16 RCTs of 2,027 peri- menopausal or postmenopausal women treated with black co- hosh using a median daily dose of 40 mg for a mean duration of 23 weeks. There was no significant difference between black cohosh and placebo in the frequency of VMS. Data on safety were inconclusive. Other literature compared black cohosh to HT in a randomized trial of three groups: group A, 1 mg estra- diol plus cyclic 4 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate; group B, 1 mg estradiol daily plus cyclic 100 mg micronized progester- one; and group C, 100 mg Cimicifuga foetida extract daily.153 The study was limited by sample size because only 81 women (84%) completed the study, and although the KI scores were re- duced in each group, there were no significant differences be- tween groups.

Despite this, the authors concluded that C foetida extract could alleviate VMS after 12 weeks. Another large sys- tematic review (35 studies and one meta-analysis) noted that the effects of C foetida was possibly dose-dependent as well as augmented when combined with other products such as St. John’s wort.154 At this time, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of black cohosh for VMS.

Dioscorea barbasco, D mexicana, and D villosa are the varieties of wild yam most commonly used. D villosa, also known as Mexican yam or wild yam root, contains diosgenin, a steroid precursor used in the manufacture of syn- thetic steroids. Diosgenin is converted in vitro to progesterone, but there is no biochemical pathway for this conversion in vivo. Evidence for Dioscorea for VMS is limited. One clinical trial employing a yam cream to treat VMS reported no significant benefit.155 Tested yam creams often do not contain any yam ex- tract, and many have been adulterated with undisclosed steroids, including estrogens, progesterone, and medroxyprogesterone acetate. Because of the potential harm that may result from adul- terants and lack of efficacy data, yam creams are not recom- mended for VMS.

Researchers enrolled 71 women in an RCT of 4.5 g dong quai per day or placebo.156 After 24 weeks, there were no differences in VMS frequency; KI scores; levels of FSH, LH, or estradiol; vaginal maturation index; or endometrial thickness. Dong quai does not appear to alleviate VMS, and there are a number of safety concerns, including possible photo- sensitization, anticoagulation, and carcinogenicity. (Level II; not recommended) Evening primrose, Oenothera biennis L, is a flowering plant rich in linolenic acid and γ-linolenic acid. There is a single trial of evening primrose oil for menopause symptoms in which 56 women were randomized to evening primrose oil 500 mg per day or placebo for 6 months.157 Evening primrose oil did not show benefit over placebo, with VMS declining by 1.0 per day with evening primrose oil and by 2.6 per day with placebo. (Level II; not recommended) Maca (Lepidium Meyennii Walp, Lepidium peruvianum Chacon), a traditional foodstuff from South America, contains a weak phytosterol (β-sitosterol) also found in several other bo- tanicals such as saw palmetto. Both methanolic and aqueous ex- tracts of maca exhibit estrogenic activity in vitro, but studies have found no in vivo estrogenic effects. In a systematic review, four studies showed improvements in Greene Climacteric Scale or KI scores. However, because of quality, design, sample sizes, or limited reporting of study data,158 existing evidence is not strong enough to support the use of maca for VMS.

There are two distinct true ginsengs in common use; Panax ginseng and Panax quinquefolius, as well as a third substance, Siberian ginseng (Acanthopanax senticosus or Eleutherococcus senticosus), a member of a closely related family of plants (Araliacea). In a study of a specific proprietary product, G115 (Ginsana in the United States), 384 postmeno- pausal women were randomized to G115 or placebo.159 After 16 weeks, women taking G115 did not show greater VMS reduc- tions than with placebo. Similarly, researchers found no significant effect of Korean red ginseng on VMS frequency versus pla- cebo.160 A second study similarly found that ginseng failed to affect VMS when measured by the KI and the MRS.161 Thus, ginseng does not appear to be beneficial for VMS. (Level I; not recommended) Labisia pumila/Eurycoma longifolia was studied in a double-blind, 24-week RCT of women aged 41 to 55 years (N = 119) experiencing menopause symptoms (MRS and MSQOL questionnaire used for assessment of symptoms).162 At week 12, the group randomized to active treatment experi- enced improvement in symptoms (65%) compared with placebo (60%; P < .01). However, at weeks 12 to 24, significant im- provement in the MRS and MSQOL questionnaire scores were noted in both treatment and placebo groups (P < .001). Overall, the authors concluded that there were no significant differences in menopause symptoms between treatment and placebo groups. (Level I; not recommended) Chasteberry. Vitex species have estrogenic properties, and compounds such as apigenin and penduletin are their ER-β-selective compounds, whereas rotundifuran and agnuside activate ER- α-dependent responses.163 Four double-blind RCTs have tested supplements containing varying amounts of Vitex agnus-castus (an amount equivalent to 1,000 mg dried vitex fruit,164,165 50 mg of vitex fruit extract,166 or 125 mg vitex fruit167) in combination with various other supplements165-167 or combined with",

The largest and most rigorous trial (n = 100) compared a mixed supplement to placebo and found no group differences in daily diary VMS frequency or questionnaire VMS intensity after 16 weeks of treatment.165 The remaining three smaller (<50 women/group) trials used less rigorous questionnaire-only measures of VMS (rather than diaries) and found significant reductions in VMS frequency, bother, or intensity ratings after 8 to 12 weeks of treatment.164,166,167 Few AEs were reported in any of the trials. Because of differences in the compounds that were tested, it is not possible to conclude that Vitex alone im- proves VMS. (Level II; not recommended) Milk thistle is a member of the Asteracease family, a thera- peutic herb used for fever and kidney and spleen disease. One previous study evaluated its effect in polyherbal formulations that included black cohosh, dong quai, and other herbs. It has been evaluated in a small RCT of 40 women receiving Silybum marianum extract and 40 women receiving placebo over a 12-week period and reported improvement in hot flashes and night sweats severity over placebo.168 Because of the limitations of one study, there is not enough evidence to make a recommen- dation.

(Level II; not recommended) Omega-3 fatty acid supplements contain polyunsaturated fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and α-linolenic acid. Phospholipids, a major component of neuronal cells, contain a high prevalence of fatty acids. Two trials have evaluated omega-3s for VMS: In an 8-week trial of 91 women randomized to placebo or omega-3 supplement (total daily dose, 1,100 mg eicosapentaenoic acid plus 50 mg docosahexaenoic acid), VMS frequency and intensity were signif- icantly improved with omega-3 compared with placebo.169 In a 12-week trial, women were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to NAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, Vol. 30, No. 6, 2023 581 omega-3s (n = 177) or placebo (n = 178) and simultaneously in a 3:3:4 ratio to yoga (n = 107), aerobic exercise (n = 106), or their usual physical activity (n = 142). There were no significant differences in VMS frequency or bother with omega-3s or pla- cebo.170 Therefore, there is mixed and inconclusive evidence for the use of omega-3s for the management of VMS. (Levels I- II; not recommended) Vitamin E. Previous studies investigating the effects of vita- min E for VMS treatment included two crossover trials (N = 120; N = 50) that showed limited reduction in VMS fre- quency with vitamin E compared with placebo.171,172 There is very little evidence for vitamin E having significant benefit in re- ducing VMS. A study from Iran with a total of 93 participants evaluated the use of curcumin alone and vitamin E alone in reduc- ing VMS as well as other symptoms of menopause versus pla- cebo (30 women/group).173 There was some improvement seen at 4 weeks for curcumin and at 8 weeks for vitamin E compared with placebo. Results were significant at 4 weeks for curcumin and at 8 weeks for vitamin E, but sample sizes were small, limit- ing conclusions. Therefore, vitamin E is not recommended for the management of VMS.",

(Level I; not recommended) Cannabinoids The data evaluating the relationship between cannabinoids and menopause symptoms is very limited. This lack of evidence is particularly notable because more than one-quarter of women have used or are using marijuana to treat their menopause symp- toms.174 A systematic review found only three small studies that evaluated cannabis use and its associations with menopause symptoms, including VMS, insomnia, mood, and depression/ anxiety.175 Based on the lack of available evidence, cannabi- noids cannot be recommended for the treatment of VMS. (Level II; not recommended) Key points • Given mixed evidence of benefit for VMS, soy foods, soy ex- tracts, and the soy metabolite equol are not recommended. • Given the lack of rigorous, evidence-based scientific re- search supporting the use of any over-the-counter supple- ments and herbal therapies for the management of VMS, these remedies are not recommended. • Cannabinoids are not recommended for the treatment of VMS. ACUPUNCTURE, OTHER TREATMENTS, AND TECHNOLOGIES Acupuncture Acupuncture is a component of the ancient practice of tradi- tional Chinese medicine in which thin needles are inserted into the skin at key points in the body and activated through specific movements (manual acupuncture) or with electrical stimulation (electroacupuncture) to create an energy flow, or Qi, which is believed to improve overall health.

Sham acupuncture is a placebo-equivalent treatment involving needles inserted at unre- lated points or needles that do not pierce the skin. Over the last decade, several systematic reviews and meta-analyses examined acupuncture versus no treatment or sham intervention for the treatment of VMS. In most systematic reviews,176-178 as well as in RCTs,179 acupuncture was deemed to alleviate some menopause-related symptoms (eg, mood, sleep, pain) as reflected in the reduction in menopause-related total scores (eg, KI, Greene Climacteric Scale) or the improvement in quality-of-life measurements (eg, MSQOL questionnaire); it had, however, little to no clinical benefit for the improvement of VMS compared with sham interventions, either for symp- tomatic midlife women or for survivors of breast cancer. Consistent with this conclusion, a 2018 study (umbrella meta-analysis) that included three systematic reviews and four RCTs found modest benefits of acupuncture for the alleviation of menopause-related symptoms, quality of life, and VMS sever- ity or frequency when treatments were compared with no treat- ment.180 Results, however, were no longer clinically significant when acupuncture was compared with sham intervention. There has been a considerable debate regarding the use of ap- propriate comparisons or control groups in acupuncture studies; some have argued, for example, that sham interventions may not be physiologically inert and therefore would not be the most ap- propriate comparison for studies or trials that aim to inform clin- ical practice.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] regarding the use of ap- propriate comparisons or control groups in acupuncture studies; some have argued, for example, that sham interventions may not be physiologically inert and therefore would not be the most ap- propriate comparison for studies or trials that aim to inform clin- ical practice. It is important to note that although most studies that compared traditional acupuncture with sham interventions found no significant difference in VMS frequency or severity, trials with electroacupuncture showed some benefits with this intervention and even stronger results for electroacupuncture when compared with manual acupuncture.181 In a 2021 model-based meta-analysis, Li and colleagues assessed 17 studies (1,123 participants), including manual acu- puncture, electroacupuncture, and sham acupuncture.178 The au- thors found that after 8 weeks of treatment, both electroacupuncture and a combination of both acupuncture modalities (traditional acupuncture and electroacupuncture) led to significant reduc- tion of VMS per day compared with sham intervention. More- over, the benefits of electroacupuncture for VMS were compa- rable to those reported in previous studies using nonhormone, pharmacologic treatments such as SSRIs, SNRIs, gabapentin, and escitalopram. Existing evidence does not support the use of traditional acu- puncture for the treatment of VMS, neither for midlife women nor for VMS in survivors of breast cancer. (Level I; not recom- mended). The use of electroacupuncture, although more promising, still warrants further investigation.

    "[INTRODUCTION] management, including for migraine and complex regional pain syndrome. The treatment is accomplished through the injection of an anesthetic agent at the lower cervical or upper thoracic region because the stellate ganglion is located bilaterally in the C6-T2 re- gion of the anterior cervical spine. Adverse events, such as tran- sient seizures or a bleeding complication, are extremely rare and minimized using imaging guidance during the procedure.182 Stellate ganglion blockade has emerged as a potential treat- ment option for VMS in both midlife women and those with breast cancer, although the exact mechanism of action of stellate ganglion blockade on VMS remains unclear. NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 582 Menopause, Vol. 30, No. 6, 2023 © 2023 by The North American Menopause Society One randomized, sham-controlled trial assessed active stel- late ganglion blockade with bupivacaine versus a sham proce- dure (subcutaneous saline injection) for VMS in women with natural or surgical menopause (N = 40).183 Over a 6-month follow-up, there was a reduction in subjectively reported VMS intensity and frequency (moderate to very severe) in the stellate ganglion blockade group compared with the sham-control group. Moreover, there was a reduction (21%, P < .05) of physiologic VMS measured with ambulatory skin conductance monitors from baseline to 3 months in the stellate ganglion blockade group, whereas the sham-control group showed no reduction. Four uncon- trolled, open-label studies showed that stellate ganglion blockade reduced VMS, with effects ranging from a 45% to a 90% reduc- tion 6 weeks to several months after blockade.184-187 In a study of patients with breast cancer (N = 40), stellate gan- glion blockade (10 mL 0.5% bupivacaine injected bilaterally) was compared with paroxetine 7.5 mg per day over a 6-week pe- riod.188 Both treatments had a positive effect on an index com- prising both VMS frequency and severity, with no significant differences between treatments.",

Overall, stellate ganglion blockade might help alleviate mod- erate to very severe VMS in select women. Results from ongo- ing larger RCTs are needed to provide more definitive evidence. Given that stellate ganglion blockade is a procedure that in- volves potential risks and AEs, its potential use for VMS should be carefully evaluated. (Levels II-III; recommended) Calibration of neural oscillations High-resolution, relational, resonance-based electroencephalic mirroring is a closed-loop acoustic stimulation neurotechnology based on the principle of allostasis. Essentially, scalp sensors and software algorithms translate specific brain frequencies into audible tones of varying pitch in real time, and these tones are immediately mirrored back via ear buds, allowing the brain to “listen to itself” in an acoustic mirror. High-resolution, rela- tional, resonance-based electroencephalic mirroring has shown some preliminary benefits for the management of insomnia189 and for military-related stress.190 In an uncontrolled study, 14 women showed a significant re- duction in VMS frequency and severity after administration with high-resolution, relational, resonance-based electroencephalic mirroring aimed at autocalibration of neural oscillations.191 Given the lack of controlled trials, high-resolution, relational, resonance-based electroencephalic mirroring is not recom- mended for treatment of VMS.",

(Level II; not recommended) Chiropractic intervention There have been no clinical trials of chiropractic interventions for VMS, and epidemiologic survey data show no association be- tween use of such interventions and VMS.192 Chiropractic inter- ventions are not recommended for treatment of VMS. (Level II; not recommended) Key points • Existing evidence does not support the use of traditional acu- puncture for the treatment of VMS; electroacupuncture re- quires more rigorous study before it can be recommended. • Stellate ganglion blockade might alleviate moderate to very severe VMS in select women but is associated with potential risk. • Calibration of neural oscillations and chiropractic interven- tions are not recommended for treatment of VMS. RECOMMENDATIONS Vasomotor symptoms are common in midlife women and re- main undertreated. These symptoms can disrupt a women’s overall quality of life and last a mean duration of 7 to 9 years, longer in some women. Hormone therapy remains the first-line recommended treatment to ameliorate VMS in healthy women at or around the time of menopause. However, it is important to recognize that not all women are candidates for HT because of contraindications or personal preference.

    "[INTRODUCTION] Editorial For most women, menopause is a natural phase of life that they transition as part of biological ageing. However, as highlighted in a Series of four papers in today’s Lancet—published ahead of International Women’s Day on March 8—commercial companies and individuals with vested interests have over-medicalised menopause. The framing of this natural period of transition as a disease of oestrogen deficiency that can be eased only by replacing the missing hormones fuels negative attitudes to menopause and exacerbates stigma. Furthermore, appropriation of feminist narratives by commercial organisations, which position use of menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT) as a way to empower women to regain control of their bodies, while downplaying risks, further endorses the framing of menopause as a disease. As described in the Series, women’s experience of menopause varies hugely and there is no one-size-fits- all approach to management. Many women transition this stage of life uneventfully, whereas some experience prolonged or severe symptoms and need information, support, or medical treatment. The most common symptoms associated with menopause include vasomotor symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats, sleep disturbances, vaginal dryness, and muscle and joint pain. Menopause is commonly perceived to be associated with poor mental health. However, there is no strong evidence that the risk of first-onset clinical depression is increased over the menopause, although this can be a vulnerable period for recurrence in those with previous clinical depression. MHT is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms, but it is not without risk: robust epidemiological evidence suggests that one additional case of breast cancer will occur for every 50 women taking systemic, combined MHT from age 50 years, and one in 70 for oestrogen-only MHT. There is no excess risk from vaginal oestrogen.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] for vasomotor symptoms, but it is not without risk: robust epidemiological evidence suggests that one additional case of breast cancer will occur for every 50 women taking systemic, combined MHT from age 50 years, and one in 70 for oestrogen-only MHT. There is no excess risk from vaginal oestrogen. All women who request MHT, after weighing up the short- term and long-term benefits and risks with their clinician, should be offered treatment unless contraindicated. Acute shortages of MHT, as seen in many parts of the world, could have a detrimental effect on women’s quality of life. Not all women wish to, or can, take MHT however, and treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy can also help to counter vasomotor symptoms and potentially improve mood and sleep. Easy access to impartial information—not from those who are marketing a product or service—both before and during the menopause transition, as well as an informed, engaged clinician who will listen with empathy, are crucial to facilitate shared decision making. Historically, women have been poorly served by both the research community and by society. At The Lancet, we are redoubling our efforts in this regard by designating Women and Health as one of our areas of focus in 2024, with the aim of showcasing important work and promoting sex and gender equity in research. Increased awareness and advocacy of women’s health are crucial to reverse the long-standing gender biases in medicine. But over- medicalisation of menopause and promotion of MHT as a panacea is unhelpful and only serves to divide opinions further. It is time for a sensible conversation about menopause to enable informed, individualised decision making on optimal management of this transition. Greater diversity in research that addresses priority areas for women is needed. A paucity of information and education on menopause has led to symptoms being dismissed by uninformed health-care professionals and a lack of understanding in the workplace.",
    "[INTRODUCTION] ng on optimal management of this transition. Greater diversity in research that addresses priority areas for women is needed. A paucity of information and education on menopause has led to symptoms being dismissed by uninformed health-care professionals and a lack of understanding in the workplace. After failed attempts in the UK to make menopause, like pregnancy, a protected characteristic under the 2010 Equality Act, the Equality and Human Rights Commission released guidance recently suggesting that menopause symptoms could be considered a disability if disruptive enough to interfere with everyday activities, and that employers are legally obliged to make reasonable adjustments. However, interpreting menopause more broadly as a disability risks further fuelling the ageism and stigma that older women already face. Menopausal women can be strong, healthy, and happy—as highlighted by the selection of inspirational images of older women that accompany the Series. Menopause can also be a time for women to reassess their identities, to embrace this next phase in their lives and the freedom from menstruation and menstrual pain, and to challenge negative perceptions of older women, which are prevalent in some societies. We need to send a realistic, balanced message to women and to society: menopause does not herald the start of a period of decay and decline but is a developmental life stage that can be negotiated successfully with access to evidence- based information as well as appropriate social and medical support. Women deserve nothing less.
