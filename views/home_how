The "One-A-Day" Reframing
The Daily Sync
To help SELENE find patterns in your neurobiology, we use a single 60-second Daily Sync. No tracking throughout the day. Just one moment to reflect, recalibrate, and give SELENE the data she needs to map your transition.

🌓 The 3-Pillar Pulse
In one quick screen, you'll capture the story of your last 24 hours:

Rest: Did you have a "3 AM Awakening" or restorative sleep?

Climate: Was your "Internal Weather" cool, flashing, or heavy?

Clarity: Did you feel focused or was the "Brain Fog" present?

🧠 The "Mind-Dump" (Optional)
Record a quick text about a specific moment (e.g.,
"unusual irritability at lunch"). SELENE processes this locally and privately to connect your mood to your endocrine rhythms.

Why Once a Day?
Consistency is the key to clarity. By spending 60 seconds each evening (or morning), SELENE’s local engine can eventually tell you: "Your 'Short Fuse' episodes almost always follow a '3 AM Awakening.' This suggests your irritability is a physiological response to a cortisol spike, not a personality change."


SELENE is not a period tracker. She doesn’t ask for or record your cycle data and it isn't required to understand your neurobiology. In midlife, the old "28-day" maps often stop making sense. Instead of tracking cycles, SELENE tracks Neurobiological Rhythms—the real-time relationship between your hormones, your sleep, and your brain.

1. The "Card-Based" Pillar Layout
Instead of long, thin lines, group each pillar into a distinct card. This makes the "target" for the user's thumb (or mouse) much larger.

Rest (Pillar 1): Use a horizontal button group.

Labels: 3 AM Awakening | Interrupted | Restorative

Interaction: When clicked, the button fills with your Vibrant Orange (#FF8C00).

Climate (Pillar 2): Use a "Heat Stepper."

Instead of a slider, use a row of 5 squares.

As the user selects a higher intensity, the squares transition from Soft Yellow (#F7D76D) to Burnt Orange (#B7410E).

Clarity (Pillar 3): A simple 3-way toggle.

Labels: Brain Fog | Neutral | High Clarity

2. Implementation Strategy (Streamlit Code)
To move away from the red sliders while keeping your current UI's clean aesthetic, I recommend using st.segmented_control (a newer Streamlit feature) or a custom button row. This eliminates the "difficult interaction" of the red lines.

Python
import streamlit as st

# Custom CSS to apply your LUCIA Palette
st.markdown(f"""
    <style>
    /* Styling the container cards */
    .stSecondaryBlock {
    {
        background-color: #ffffff;
        padding: 20px;
        border-radius: 15px;
        border: 1px solid #f0f0f0;
        margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
}
/* Making buttons feel organic and 'LUCIA' */
    div.stButton > button {
    {
        background-color: #F7D76D; /* Soft Golden Yellow */
        color: #5D3A1A; /* Earthy Brown */
        border: none;
        border-radius: 8px;
        transition: all 0.3s;
    }
}
    div.stButton > button:hover {
    {
        background-color: #FF8C00; /* Vitality Orange */
        color: white;
    }
}
    </style>
    """, unsafe_allow_input=True)

st.title("Daily Attune")

# PILLAR 1: REST
st.subheader("Rest")
rest_option = st.segmented_control(
    "How was your sleep?",
[
    "3 AM Awakening",
    "Fragmented",
    "Restorative"

    selection_mode="single"
)

# PILLAR 2: CLIMATE
st.subheader("Internal Weather")
# Using a selectbox or segmented control instead of a slider for 'Climate'

    "Intensity of Hot Flashes",
    options=[

# PILLAR 3: CLARITY
st.subheader("Clarity")
clarity_level = st.segmented_control(

# MIND DUMP

st.text_area("Record a specific moment (Private & Local)", placeholder="e.g., unusual irritability at lunch...")

if st.button("Save Entry", use_container_width=True):
    st.success("Attune Captured.")

Typography: Use a serif font for the Pillar titles (like Playfair Display or Lora) to give it a more "journal" and feminine feel, while keeping the input labels in a clean sans-serif.

Weight & Space: Increase the line-height in your "Mind-Dump" text area. It makes the text feel less cramped and more like a space for reflection.
